=================== 1. Getting started with node JS=======================
1) Defination:
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome. Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications, particularly those that require real-time interactions, such as chat applications, gaming servers, and collaborative tools.

2) Event-driven:
Event-driven architecture is a design where the flow of a program is controlled by events. An event can be anything from a user action, like a mouse click, to a message from another program.

### Key Points:

1. **Event**: Something that happens (e.g., a button click).
2. **Event Emitter**: The part that generates the event.
3. **Event Listener**: The part that waits for and responds to the event.
4. **Callback**: The function that runs when the event happens.

### How It Works:

1. **Listen**: You set up an event listener to wait for an event.
2. **Emit**: An event occurs, triggering the event emitter.
3. **Respond**: The listener detects the event and runs the callback function.

### Example:

In a web page:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

In Node.js:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('An event occurred!');
});

emitter.emit('event');
```

### Pros:

- **Responsive**: Good for real-time applications.
- **Flexible**: Can handle many different events easily.

### Cons:

- **Complex**: Can become hard to manage with many events.
- **Performance**: Can be slower due to the overhead of handling events.


3) Pros and cons:
### Pros of Node.js:

1. **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
2. **Fast Performance**: The V8 engine compiles JavaScript to native machine code, making execution extremely fast.
3. **Single Programming Language**: Developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side scripting, leading to a more unified development experience.
4. **Rich Ecosystem**: With npm (Node Package Manager), Node.js has a vast library of packages and modules, which can significantly speed up development.
5. **Scalability**: Node.js is designed for scalability, supporting microservices and real-time applications.
6. **Large Community**: A large and active community provides support, tutorials, and shared resources, making it easier to find help and collaborate.
7. **Cross-Platform**: Node.js can run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing flexibility in deployment.

### Cons of Node.js:

1. **Single-Threaded Limitations**: Node.js is single-threaded, which can be a drawback for CPU-intensive tasks. While it handles I/O operations well, it may struggle with heavy computational tasks.
2. **Callback Hell**: The extensive use of callbacks can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code, often referred to as "callback hell." Promises and async/await have mitigated this issue to some extent.
3. **Maturity of Libraries**: Some npm packages may not be as mature or well-maintained as libraries in other ecosystems, leading to potential security risks or bugs.
4. **Error Handling**: Error handling in asynchronous code can be tricky and may require additional effort to manage effectively.
5. **Tooling and Debugging**: While tooling and debugging support has improved, it may not be as robust as in more established languages and frameworks.
6. **Concurrency Issues**: While Node.js is good at handling multiple concurrent connections, it may not be the best choice for applications that require heavy parallel processing.


4) Hash function in nodeJS:
A hash function in JavaScript is a function that takes an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a "digest" that is unique to each unique input, making it useful for various applications like data lookup, cryptography, and more.

Here’s an example of a simple hash function using the built-in `crypto` module in Node.js:

### Using Node.js `crypto` Module

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function hashString(str) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(str).digest('hex');
}

const myString = "Hello, world!";
const hashedString = hashString(myString);

console.log(hashedString);
```

In the example above:
- `crypto.createHash('sha256')` creates a hash object using the SHA-256 algorithm.
- `.update(str)` updates the hash object with the input string.
- `.digest('hex')` computes the hash and returns it as a hexadecimal string.

### Using Browser JavaScript (without Node.js)

For hashing in the browser, you can use the Web Crypto API, which is available in modern browsers:

```javascript
async function hashString(str) {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const data = encoder.encode(str);
  const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data);
  const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
  const hashHex = hashArray.map(byte => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
  return hashHex;
}

const myString = "Hello, world!";
hashString(myString).then(hashedString => console.log(hashedString));
```

In the example above:
- `TextEncoder` encodes the string into a `Uint8Array`.
- `crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data)` computes the SHA-256 hash.
- The result is converted to a hexadecimal string for easy readability.

### Simple Custom Hash Function

For educational purposes, here’s a simple (but not cryptographically secure) hash function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function simpleHash(str) {
  let hash = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    const char = str.charCodeAt(i);
    hash = (hash << 5) - hash + char;
    hash |= 0; // Convert to 32bit integer
  }
  return hash;
}

const myString = "Hello, world!";
const hashedString = simpleHash(myString);

console.log(hashedString);
```

This function:
- Iterates over each character in the string.
- Uses bitwise operations to compute a simple hash.

### Note

-- For security-sensitive applications, always use well-established libraries and algorithms like SHA-256 provided by the `crypto` module or Web Crypto API. Simple custom hash functions are generally not suitable for secure hashing. 
-- Decoding a hash function output to retrieve the original input is generally not possible. This is by design, as hash functions are intended to be one-way functions. Once data has been hashed, it cannot be easily reversed. Hash functions like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 are specifically designed to be irreversible.


5) Middleware:
Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between different parts of an application or between different applications. In web development, middleware typically refers to functions that process requests and responses in a web server or application framework before they reach the final handler or after they leave it. Middleware can perform a variety of tasks, such as logging, authentication, error handling, and data parsing.

### Key Points About Middleware:

1. **Intermediary**: Middleware functions operate between the client request and the server response, performing actions on the request and/or response objects.
2. **Reusable**: Middleware can be used across multiple routes and applications, making it a reusable component.
3. **Chaining**: Middleware functions can be chained together to handle requests in a sequential manner. Each middleware function can pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

### How Middleware Works:

When a request is received by the server, it passes through a series of middleware functions before reaching the final request handler. Each middleware function can modify the request or response, perform operations, and decide whether to pass control to the next function in the chain or end the response.

### Example in Express.js (a popular Node.js framework):

#### Logging Middleware Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function to log request details
function logRequests(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
}

app.use(logRequests);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example:
- `logRequests` is a middleware function that logs the request method and URL.
- `app.use(logRequests)` adds this middleware to the application, so it runs for every incoming request.
- The `next()` function is called to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

### Types of Middleware:

1. **Application-Level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of `express` using `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()`.
   
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log('Application-level middleware');
     next();
   });
   ```

2. **Router-Level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of `express.Router()`, used for modularizing the application.
   
   ```javascript
   const router = express.Router();
   
   router.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log('Router-level middleware');
     next();
   });
   
   app.use('/route', router);
   ```

3. **Error-Handling Middleware**: Defined with four arguments and used to handle errors in the application.
   
   ```javascript
   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
     console.error(err.stack);
     res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
   });
   ```

4. **Built-in Middleware**: Provided by Express, such as `express.static` for serving static files and `express.json` for parsing JSON payloads.
   
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.json());
   app.use(express.static('public'));
   ```

5. **Third-Party Middleware**: Middleware provided by third-party libraries, such as `morgan` for logging or `cors` for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
   
   ```javascript
   const morgan = require('morgan');
   app.use(morgan('tiny'));
   ```


6) REPL in node:
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive shell that processes single lines of input, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user. Node.js includes a built-in REPL that allows you to execute JavaScript code in a command-line environment interactively. This is useful for experimenting with code snippets, debugging, and learning.

To start the REPL, simply type node in your terminal and press Enter:
```
$ node```
You will see a prompt (>) where you can start typing JavaScript code.

7) Global object and module:
The global object in Node.js provides a way to define variables and functions that are accessible across different modules without importing them explicitly.
Global modules defined using the global object can be useful for sharing utility functions or constants across modules, but caution should be exercised to avoid polluting the global namespace.
Best practices in Node.js development often favor encapsulation and dependency injection over extensive use of global variables and modules to promote modularity and maintainability.

8) Js in browser vs Server-side:
JavaScript (JS) can operate in two primary environments: the browser and Node.js. Here's a comparison of JavaScript usage in these two contexts:

### JavaScript in Browser:

1. **Execution Environment:**
   - **Client-side:** JavaScript runs directly in the user's web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
   - **Interpreted:** Browsers interpret and execute JavaScript code natively.

2. **Core Capabilities:**
   - **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate webpage content dynamically.
   - **Event Handling:** Captures and responds to user actions (e.g., clicks, inputs) and browser events (e.g., load, resize).
   - **AJAX Requests:** Sends and receives data asynchronously to/from servers using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API.
   - **Animations:** Uses libraries like CSS transitions/animations or JavaScript frameworks (e.g., GSAP) for complex animations.

3. **ECMAScript Standards:**
   - **ES6+ Support:** Browsers progressively support modern JavaScript features specified in ECMAScript (ES) standards.

4. **Development Tools:**
   - **Browser Developer Tools:** Debugging, profiling, and inspecting DOM elements during development.

### JavaScript in Node.js Environment:

1. **Execution Environment:**
   - **Server-side:** JavaScript runs on the server using Node.js, a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
   - **Interpreted:** Node.js interprets JavaScript code and executes it on the server.

2. **Core Capabilities:**
   - **File System Operations:** Accesses and manipulates files and directories on the server.
   - **Server-Side Logic:** Handles backend logic, such as business operations, database interactions, and API endpoints.
   - **Command-Line Tools:** Develops and runs command-line utilities or scripts using Node.js.

3. **ECMAScript Standards:**
   - **ES6+ Support:** Node.js supports modern JavaScript features, often adopting them more quickly than browsers.

4. **Development Tools:**
   - **Node.js CLI:** Command-line tools for managing packages (npm or yarn), running scripts, and managing dependencies.
   - **Debugging:** Utilizes debuggers like Chrome DevTools (via inspector) or dedicated Node.js debuggers (e.g., VS Code debugger).

### Key Differences:

- **Environment:** Browser JS focuses on client-side interactions and UI, while Node.js JS handles server-side operations and backend logic.
- **APIs:** Browser JS interacts with DOM, handles events, and makes AJAX requests. Node.js JS manages files, databases, networking, and other server-side tasks.
- **Modules:** Node.js uses CommonJS (prior to ES6) or ES Modules (ES6+). Browser JS traditionally used `<script>` tags or module loaders (now supports ES Modules).
- **Concurrency:** Node.js operates with single-threaded, event-driven architecture (supports concurrency via async operations). Browsers handle concurrency with multi-threaded environments (e.g., Web Workers).



========================= 2.Modules in NodeJS========================================

1) CommonJS vs. ES6 Modules in Node.js
In Node.js, modules are a way to encapsulate code into separate files and reuse them across the application. There are two main module systems in use:

CommonJS Modules:

Usage: CommonJS is the older module system used in Node.js. It uses require to import modules and module.exports or exports to export them.
Syntax:
Importing: const math = require('./math.js');
Exporting: module.exports = { sum, mean };
Behavior: Synchronously loads modules, making it well-suited for server-side development.
ES6 Modules:

Usage: ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced a new standardized module system that is also supported in Node.js. It uses import and export statements.
Syntax:
Importing: import { sum, mean } from './math.js';
Exporting: export { sum, mean };

Behavior: Supports asynchronous module loading and can be used in both client-side and server-side JavaScript.
Key Differences
Syntax: CommonJS uses require and module.exports, while ES6 uses import and export.
Asynchronous Loading: ES6 modules are designed to support asynchronous loading, whereas CommonJS modules are synchronous.
Tree Shaking: ES6 modules support tree shaking, which allows bundlers to eliminate unused code.

2) Axios package:
**Axios** is a popular promise-based HTTP client used in Node.js to make HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of interacting with REST APIs by allowing you to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and handle their responses effectively.

**Key Features:**
- Supports promises, allowing chaining with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
- Automatically transforms the response data to JSON.
- Allows making requests like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.
- Supports request and response interception.
- Simplifies handling of query strings and URL parameters.

### Installation
You can install Axios in your Node.js project via npm:

```bash
npm install axios
```

### Basic Example: `GET` Request

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data); // Response data is automatically parsed
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });
```

### `POST` Request Example

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

axios.post('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
    title: 'New Post',
    body: 'This is the body of the new post',
    userId: 1
  })
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Post Created:', response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error posting data:', error);
  });
```

14. **Design an Axios request to handle chunked responses for large datasets.**
15. **What are some ways to optimize Axios requests for performance in a high-traffic Node.js server?**

3) Package Manager:
Node.js uses a **package manager** to handle third-party libraries, modules, and dependencies for your project. The two most commonly used package managers in Node.js are **npm (Node Package Manager)** and **Yarn**. They allow developers to install, manage, and share reusable code modules, enabling efficient project development.

#### 1. **npm (Node Package Manager)**

**npm** is the default package manager for Node.js. It comes pre-installed when you install Node.js. It allows you to download and manage libraries and dependencies for your projects.

**Key Features:**
- Access to the **npm registry**, a vast repository of open-source packages.
- Allows developers to easily install packages and their dependencies.
- Handles version control and updates for packages.

### Common `npm` Commands:

1. **Initialize a project**:
   ```bash
   npm init
   ```
   This creates a `package.json` file that manages project dependencies.

2. **Install a package**:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```
   This command installs a package and adds it to the `node_modules` folder.

3. **Install a package globally**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```
   Installs the package globally on your system, so it can be used across all projects.

4. **Install a specific version of a package**:
   ```bash
   npm install axios@0.21.1
   ```

5. **Update all installed packages**:
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```

6. **Uninstall a package**:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall axios
   ```

7. **List installed packages**:
   ```bash
   npm list
   ```

---

#### 2. **Yarn**

**Yarn** is an alternative package manager developed by Facebook. It is faster than npm in most cases and focuses on reliability and deterministic installs.

**Key Features:**
- Uses **lock files** (`yarn.lock`) for deterministic and consistent dependency resolution.
- Parallel installation of packages, making it faster than npm.
- Compatible with npm, meaning packages from the npm registry can be installed with Yarn.

### Common `Yarn` Commands:

1. **Initialize a project**:
   ```bash
   yarn init
   ```

2. **Add a package**:
   ```bash
   yarn add axios
   ```

3. **Add a global package**:
   ```bash
   yarn global add nodemon
   ```

4. **Remove a package**:
   ```bash
   yarn remove axios
   ```

5. **Update a package**:
   ```bash
   yarn upgrade axios
   ```

6. **Install all project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Example:

**Using npm to install Axios**:

```bash
npm install axios
```

**Using Yarn to install Axios**:

```bash
yarn add axios
```

Both commands install the Axios package but with different package managers.

5. **Explain what the `node_modules` folder is.**
   *The `node_modules` folder contains all the installed dependencies for a Node.js project.*

6. **What is the purpose of the `package-lock.json` file in npm?**
   *The `package-lock.json` file ensures deterministic installs by locking the exact versions of packages and dependencies used in the project.*

7. **How do you install a package as a development dependency using npm?**
   *By using the `--save-dev` flag:*
   ```bash
   npm install nodemon --save-dev
   ```

8. **What does the `-g` flag do in npm and Yarn?**
   *The `-g` flag installs a package globally, making it accessible system-wide.*

9. **What is a `peerDependency` in `package.json`?**
   *A `peerDependency` is a package that your package needs, but the consuming project is expected to install.*

10. **How do you uninstall a package using npm?**
    *Use the `npm uninstall` command followed by the package name:*
    ```bash
    npm uninstall axios
    ```

11. **What is `yarn.lock`, and how does it differ from `package-lock.json`?**
    *`yarn.lock` ensures that every developer working on the project has the same dependencies, similar to `package-lock.json`, but it's specific to Yarn.*

12. **Can you install npm packages with Yarn?**
    *Yes, Yarn can install packages from the npm registry.*

13. **How do you update npm or Yarn to the latest version?**
    *For npm:*
    ```bash
    npm install -g npm
    ```
    *For Yarn:*
    ```bash
    yarn set version latest
    ```

14. **What is `npm ci`, and how does it differ from `npm install`?**
    *`npm ci` is faster and meant for automated environments (e.g., CI/CD), ensuring consistent installs based on `package-lock.json`.*

15. **How do you publish a package to the npm registry?**
    *Use the `npm publish` command after configuring the package metadata.*

15. **Create a script using npm that runs multiple commands in parallel for testing and building a Node.js project.**

4) Package.json file:
### `package.json` in Node.js

The `package.json` file is an essential part of any Node.js project. It is a JSON file located in the root directory of a Node.js project and serves as the manifest for the project, holding important metadata about the project, such as its dependencies, version, entry point, scripts, and other configurations.

### Key Features of `package.json`:

1. **Project Metadata**:
   - **name**: The name of your project.
   - **version**: The current version of your project.
   - **description**: A brief description of the project.
   - **main**: The entry point for the project (e.g., `index.js`).

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Specifies external modules and packages your project depends on.
   - **dependencies**: Packages required for your project to run.
   - **devDependencies**: Packages needed only during development (e.g., testing frameworks).
   - **peerDependencies**: Specifies the version of dependencies required by your project for compatibility.

3. **Scripts**:
   - Defines custom commands that can be run via `npm run`.
   - Example: `npm start`, `npm test`.

4. **Engines**:
   - Specifies the version of Node.js or npm required to run the project.

5. **License**:
   - Specifies the license for the project.

### Basic Structure of `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-node-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "axios": "^0.21.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=14.0.0"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### Key Sections of `package.json`:

1. **Name & Version**:
   ```json
   "name": "my-node-project",
   "version": "1.0.0"
   ```
   Every Node.js project has a unique name and version. The version follows **semantic versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

2. **Scripts**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node index.js",
     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
   }
   ```
   Scripts allow you to define commands that can be run using `npm run <script>`. In this case:
   - `npm start` runs `node index.js`.
   - `npm test` is a placeholder for tests.

3. **Dependencies**:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "express": "^4.17.1",
     "axios": "^0.21.1"
   }
   ```
   These are the packages your project requires in production. When you run `npm install`, npm will install these dependencies.

4. **DevDependencies**:
   ```json
   "devDependencies": {
     "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
   }
   ```
   These are packages only needed for development purposes, such as testing libraries or tools like `nodemon`.

5. **Engines**:
   ```json
   "engines": {
     "node": ">=14.0.0"
   }
   ```
   This ensures the project runs on a specific version of Node.js or newer.

### Example: Adding a Dependency

You can add dependencies to your `package.json` by running the following commands:

```bash
npm install express --save  # Adds to dependencies
npm install nodemon --save-dev  # Adds to devDependencies
```

This automatically updates the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections of your `package.json` with the installed packages and their versions.

### Interview Questions:

1. **What is `package.json` in Node.js?**
   *`package.json` is a configuration file that holds the metadata, dependencies, and scripts for a Node.js project.*

2. **What is the difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`?**
   *`dependencies` are needed in production, while `devDependencies` are only required during development.*

3. **How does `package.json` handle semantic versioning?**
   *Semantic versioning uses a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format, where updates to the major version break backward compatibility, minor updates add features, and patch updates fix bugs.*

4. **What is the purpose of `scripts` in `package.json`?**
   *Scripts define commands that can be run with `npm run`, such as `start`, `test`, and custom commands.*

5. **What are `peerDependencies` and how are they different from `dependencies`?**
   *`peerDependencies` specify that a certain version of a package must be installed by the consumer of your package, while `dependencies` are installed directly.*

6. **How do you install only production dependencies from `package.json`?**
   *Use the `--production` flag:*
   ```bash
   npm install --production
   ```

7. **What is the purpose of the `package-lock.json` file?**
   *It ensures consistent installation of dependencies by locking their versions, avoiding potential conflicts during installation.*

8. **How do you install a specific version of a package in `package.json`?**
   *You can specify the version by running:*
   ```bash
   npm install express@4.17.1
   ```

9. **What happens if `package.json` has conflicting versions of the same package?**
   *Npm tries to resolve the conflict by creating a flat dependency tree, but it may install different versions in the `node_modules` folder if needed.*

10. **How do you ensure your Node.js app only runs on specific versions of Node?**
    *You can specify the required Node.js version in the `engines` field of `package.json`.*

11. **Can you explain what tilde (`~`) and caret (`^`) symbols mean in `package.json` versions?**

5) Package-lock.json:
### `package-lock.json` in Node.js

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by npm when you run `npm install` in a project that has a `package.json` file. It is used to lock down the versions of the installed dependencies, ensuring that the same versions are installed every time, across all environments. This file helps to maintain consistency and prevent version conflicts, especially when collaborating on a project or deploying an application.

### Purpose of `package-lock.json`:

1. **Version Locking**:
   - Ensures that all collaborators, CI/CD pipelines, and production environments use the exact same versions of dependencies.
   - Prevents potential issues caused by differences in package versions that might occur if the versions in `package.json` allow flexibility (e.g., using caret `^` or tilde `~` version ranges).

2. **Faster Installs**:
   - `package-lock.json` contains a complete dependency tree, making future installations faster since npm doesn’t have to resolve versions from scratch.

3. **Deterministic Installs**:
   - Makes sure that the project will work the same way regardless of when and where it is installed, avoiding "it works on my machine" issues.

4. **Ensures Compatibility**:
   - Prevents issues caused by incompatible versions of packages being installed. The locked versions ensure that all dependencies are compatible with each other.

### Key Properties of `package-lock.json`:

- **name**: The name of the project.
- **version**: The version of the project.
- **lockfileVersion**: The version of the lock file format (e.g., `lockfileVersion: 2` for npm 7+).
- **dependencies**: A nested structure that lists the exact versions of all installed dependencies, including transitive dependencies (i.e., the dependencies of your dependencies).
- **integrity**: A hash to ensure the integrity of the package.
- **resolved**: The resolved URL where the package was fetched from (e.g., a CDN or npm registry).

### Example `package-lock.json` File:

```json
{
  "name": "my-node-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 2,
  "requires": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "4.17.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.17.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-...",
      "requires": {
        "accepts": "~1.3.7",
        "body-parser": "~1.19.0",
        "debug": "~2.6.9"
      }
    },
    "axios": {
      "version": "0.21.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/axios/-/axios-0.21.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-...",
      "requires": {
        "follow-redirects": "^1.10.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### When is `package-lock.json` Created/Updated?

- Created automatically when you run `npm install` for the first time in a project with a `package.json`.
- Updated whenever you add, remove, or update dependencies using `npm install`, `npm uninstall`, or `npm update`.
  
### Benefits of Using `package-lock.json`:

1. **Version Consistency**: Ensures that every developer working on the project installs the exact same versions of all dependencies and their transitive dependencies.
   
2. **Faster Installations**: Speeds up package installation because npm doesn't have to resolve versions of dependencies from scratch.

3. **Better Security**: Guarantees that the exact packages with the expected integrity (verified by their hashes) are installed, reducing the risk of malicious code sneaking into your project via third-party libraries.

4. **Reproducible Builds**: Makes deployments and continuous integration (CI) processes more predictable and consistent across different environments.

### Differences Between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`:

| Feature                | `package.json`                                      | `package-lock.json`                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Contains a list of project dependencies, metadata, and scripts. | Contains the exact versions of dependencies installed and their resolved URLs. |
| Flexibility            | Allows semver ranges (`^`, `~`) for package versions. | Locks dependencies to specific versions for deterministic installs. |
| Generated By           | Created manually or via `npm init`.                | Automatically generated/updated by npm during `npm install`. |
| File Size              | Typically smaller and more human-readable.         | Larger, contains the entire dependency tree.          |
| Required for Install   | Required to install dependencies in the project.   | Ensures consistent installs but not strictly required to install packages. |

### Example:

1. **With `package.json` only:**

   The `package.json` may contain:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "express": "^4.17.1"
   }
   ```

   Without a `package-lock.json` file, npm may install the latest version compatible with `^4.17.1`, which could be `4.18.0`, causing differences in environments.

2. **With `package-lock.json`:**

   The `package-lock.json` will lock down the version like:
   ```json
   "express": {
     "version": "4.17.1",
     "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.17.1.tgz",
     "integrity": "sha512-..."
   }
   ```

   This ensures that the exact version `4.17.1` is always installed.

8. **How does `package-lock.json` affect CI/CD pipelines?**
   *It ensures that the exact same versions of dependencies are installed in all environments, making builds and deployments more predictable.*

9. **What is the difference between `npm install` and `npm ci` in relation to `package-lock.json`?**
   *`npm ci` installs dependencies based on the exact versions in `package-lock.json`, ensuring that the install process is faster and more predictable, especially for CI/CD pipelines.*

10. **Why should you commit `package-lock.json` to version control?**
    *It ensures that all contributors and environments install the same dependency versions, providing consistent behavior across the project.*

11. **What happens if a version conflict arises between `package-lock.json` and `package.json`?**
    *npm gives priority to `package-lock.json` and installs the versions specified there.*

12. **Can `package-lock.json` prevent breaking changes in dependencies?**
    *Yes, by locking the exact versions, it prevents the project from automatically adopting breaking changes that may be introduced in newer versions.*

13. **How does npm handle transitive dependencies in `package-lock.json`?**
    *npm includes all direct and transitive (sub)dependencies in the `package-lock.json` file to ensure consistency across the entire dependency tree.*

14. **What is `lockfileVersion`, and why is it important?**
    *It indicates the version of the lockfile format. Different versions of npm use different formats, and this helps npm understand how to read the file.*

15. **How does `package-lock.json` handle updates to dependencies?**
    *When a dependency is updated, the `package-lock.json` file is updated to reflect the new version and its associated transitive dependencies.*

7) Readline module:
### `readline` in Node.js

The `readline` module in Node.js provides an interface for reading data from a `Readable` stream (such as `process.stdin` for standard input) one line at a time. It's typically used to create interactive command-line applications, prompts, and for handling user input from the terminal.

### Key Features of `readline`:
1. **Command-line Input**: 
   - Allows reading input from the terminal or any readable stream.
   - Processes input line-by-line, making it ideal for interactive programs.

2. **Customizable Prompts**: 
   - You can configure custom prompts, like when asking users for input or confirmation.

3. **Read/Write Streams**: 
   - Handles both input and output streams, allowing flexible control over how data is read and displayed.

4. **Event-based Interface**: 
   - Provides events like `line`, `close`, `pause`, and `resume` to handle input processing.

---

### Example: Simple User Input Program

This example demonstrates how to create a basic prompt using `readline` to ask the user for their name and greet them.

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

// Create an interface for reading from the process stdin (input) and stdout (output)
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

// Ask a question to the user
rl.question("What's your name? ", (answer) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${answer}!`);

  // Close the readline interface to prevent further input
  rl.close();
});
```

#### Explanation:
- **`readline.createInterface()`**: Creates an interface for reading input and output from `stdin` and `stdout`.
- **`rl.question()`**: Displays a question to the user and waits for their input.
- **`rl.close()`**: Closes the input stream, preventing any further input.

### Key Methods:

1. **`rl.question(query, callback)`**:
   - Asks a question and waits for the user's input.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     rl.question('Enter your age: ', (age) => {
       console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
     });
     ```

2. **`rl.on('line', callback)`**:
   - Reads input line-by-line (useful for large inputs or continuous input).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     rl.on('line', (input) => {
       console.log(`Received: ${input}`);
     });
     ```

3. **`rl.close()`**:
   - Closes the `readline` interface, stopping further input.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     rl.close();
     ```

---

### Example: Multi-Step Input

This example shows how you can ask multiple questions sequentially using `readline`.

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

let user = {};

rl.question("What's your name? ", (name) => {
  user.name = name;

  rl.question("What's your age? ", (age) => {
    user.age = age;

    console.log(`Hello, ${user.name}. You are ${user.age} years old.`);
    rl.close();
  });
});
```

#### Explanation:
- The program first asks the user's name, then asks for their age. After collecting both inputs, it outputs a greeting and then closes the `readline` interface.

---

### Handling Events in `readline`

The `readline` module is event-driven and emits several events that can be used to control input and output behavior.

1. **`line`**: Emitted when the input stream receives a new line (i.e., the user presses Enter).
   ```javascript
   rl.on('line', (input) => {
     console.log(`Received: ${input}`);
   });
   ```

2. **`close`**: Emitted when the input stream is closed.
   ```javascript
   rl.on('close', () => {
     console.log('Readline interface closed.');
   });
   ```

3. **`pause`**: Emitted when the input stream is paused.
   ```javascript
   rl.pause();
   ```

4. **`resume`**: Emitted when the input stream is resumed.
   ```javascript
   rl.resume();
   ```

---

### Example: Handling Continuous Input

In this example, the program reads multiple lines of input from the user until they type "exit".

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

console.log("Type 'exit' to quit.");

rl.on('line', (input) => {
  if (input.trim() === 'exit') {
    rl.close();
  } else {
    console.log(`You typed: ${input}`);
  }
});

rl.on('close', () => {
  console.log('Goodbye!');
});
```

#### Explanation:
- The `rl.on('line')` event listens for new lines of input. If the input is "exit", it closes the interface; otherwise, it echoes the user's input back to them.
- The `rl.on('close')` event triggers a goodbye message when the input stream is closed.

---

### Advanced Example: Command-Line Calculator

Here's a more advanced example where we implement a simple calculator using `readline`.

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

console.log("Simple Calculator");
console.log("Enter an expression like '5 + 3' or type 'exit' to quit.");

rl.on('line', (input) => {
  if (input.trim().toLowerCase() === 'exit') {
    rl.close();
  } else {
    try {
      // Evaluate the user's input as a mathematical expression
      let result = eval(input);
      console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Invalid expression. Try again.');
    }
  }
});

rl.on('close', () => {
  console.log('Calculator closed.');
});
```

#### Explanation:
- This calculator accepts input like `5 + 3`, evaluates it using `eval()`, and returns the result.
- The program handles invalid expressions and exits gracefully when the user types "exit".

### Tricky Challenges/Questions:

1. **How would you implement input history in a command-line interface using `readline`?**
2. **How can you add autocompletion to a `readline` interface?**
3. **What are the limitations of the `readline` module when handling large inputs?**
4. **How would you modify the prompt behavior dynamically based on user input?**
5. **How can you handle input streams other than `process.stdin` using `readline`?**

9. **How do you handle input timeouts in the `readline` module?**
10. **How would you integrate the `readline` module with promises for cleaner asynchronous input handling?**

8) File system module:

The **File System (fs)** module in Node.js allows you to interact with the file system on your machine. It provides APIs to read, write, update, and delete files and directories. The `fs` module supports both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** methods for handling file system operations, which means you can handle tasks in a blocking or non-blocking way depending on your needs.

---

### Key Features of the `fs` Module:

1. **File Operations**:
   - Create, read, write, update, delete files.
   - Handle both binary and text-based files.

2. **Directory Operations**:
   - Create, read, rename, or delete directories.

3. **Stream Support**:
   - Read and write files in chunks using streams, useful for handling large files.

4. **Asynchronous and Synchronous APIs**:
   - Use asynchronous, non-blocking methods to avoid blocking the main thread.
   - Synchronous, blocking methods are also available for simplicity in scripts.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Provides detailed error handling for file and directory operations.

---

### Example: Reading and Writing Files

#### 1. **Asynchronous File Reading and Writing**:

In the asynchronous approach, Node.js performs operations in the background, and the program can continue running while waiting for the operation to complete.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Asynchronously read a file
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);  // Outputs the file content
});

// Asynchronously write to a file
fs.writeFile('output.txt', 'Hello, world!', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File has been written');
});
```

#### 2. **Synchronous File Reading and Writing**:

In the synchronous approach, Node.js waits for the file operation to complete before moving to the next line of code. This can block the event loop, which is not recommended for large-scale applications but may be fine for scripts.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Synchronously read a file
try {
  const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}

// Synchronously write to a file
try {
  fs.writeFileSync('output.txt', 'Hello, world!');
  console.log('File has been written');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

---

### Key Methods in `fs` Module:

1. **File Reading**:
   - **Asynchronous**: `fs.readFile(path, options, callback)`
   - **Synchronous**: `fs.readFileSync(path, options)`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(data);
     });
     ```

2. **File Writing**:
   - **Asynchronous**: `fs.writeFile(path, data, callback)`
   - **Synchronous**: `fs.writeFileSync(path, data)`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'Hello World', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('File written successfully');
     });
     ```

3. **File Deletion**:
   - **Asynchronous**: `fs.unlink(path, callback)`
   - **Synchronous**: `fs.unlinkSync(path)`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fs.unlink('file.txt', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('File deleted');
     });
     ```

4. **Directory Creation**:
   - **Asynchronous**: `fs.mkdir(path, options, callback)`
   - **Synchronous**: `fs.mkdirSync(path, options)`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fs.mkdir('newDir', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Directory created');
     });
     ```

5. **Directory Removal**:
   - **Asynchronous**: `fs.rmdir(path, callback)`
   - **Synchronous**: `fs.rmdirSync(path)`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fs.rmdir('oldDir', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('Directory removed');
     });
     ```

6. **File/Directory Stats**:
   - **Asynchronous**: `fs.stat(path, callback)`
   - **Synchronous**: `fs.statSync(path)`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fs.stat('example.txt', (err, stats) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(`File Size: ${stats.size}`);
     });
     ```

7. **Rename Files or Directories**:
   - **Asynchronous**: `fs.rename(oldPath, newPath, callback)`
   - **Synchronous**: `fs.renameSync(oldPath, newPath)`
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fs.rename('oldName.txt', 'newName.txt', (err) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log('File renamed');
     });
     ```

8. **Check File Existence (Deprecated)**:
   - Deprecated: `fs.exists(path, callback)`
   - Use `fs.access()` instead:
     ```javascript
     fs.access('file.txt', fs.constants.F_OK, (err) => {
       console.log(`${err ? 'File does not exist' : 'File exists'}`);
     });
     ```

---

### Working with Streams

For large files, it's often more efficient to work with file **streams** rather than loading the entire file into memory. Node.js provides the ability to create **readable** and **writable** streams.

1. **Create a Read Stream**:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');

   const readStream = fs.createReadStream('largeFile.txt', 'utf8');
   readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
     console.log(chunk);
   });
   ```

2. **Create a Write Stream**:
   ```javascript
   const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
   writeStream.write('This is a large text file being written using a stream.');
   writeStream.end();
   ```

---

### Example: Copying a File Using Streams

Here's an example of copying a file using read and write streams:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('source.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('destination.txt');

readStream.pipe(writeStream);

writeStream.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('File copied successfully.');
});
```

### Directory Traversal Example

You can read the contents of a directory and iterate through its files or subdirectories using `fs.readdir()`.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readdir('.', (err, files) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  files.forEach(file => {
    console.log(file);
  });
});
```

1) Debugging in Node.js: 
### Debugging in Node.js: Overview

Debugging is essential for identifying and fixing issues in your code. In Node.js, several tools and methods help streamline this process, such as built-in debugging features, `console` logging, and third-party tools like `Node.js Inspector`, `Debugger`, and even IDE-based debuggers (e.g., in VSCode).

#### Common Debugging Methods in Node.js:

1. **Console Logging:**
   The simplest form of debugging involves using `console.log()` to output variables or check the flow of your code.

2. **Node.js Inspector:**
   The built-in debugger in Node.js can be accessed by running your script with the `--inspect` flag.
   ```bash
   node --inspect your_script.js
   ```
   It opens debugging ports you can attach to Chrome DevTools or VSCode.

3. **Debugging with Breakpoints:**
   Tools like VSCode allow you to set breakpoints in your code, enabling you to pause execution and inspect variable values, function calls, and more.

4. **Error Handling:**
   Use `try-catch` blocks and error-handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and identify where errors occur.

#### Example:

Here's an example of debugging a simple Node.js program:

```js
// app.js
function multiply(a, b) {
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        throw new Error('Both arguments must be numbers');
    }
    return a * b;
}

// Debugging with console.log
const result = multiply(5, '10');
console.log(result);
```

When running this program, you'll get an error:
```bash
Error: Both arguments must be numbers
```

To debug this further, you can add `console.log(a, b)` or set up a breakpoint using the Node.js inspector.

2) vs code js debugger:
### VS Code JavaScript Debugger: Overview

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides a powerful built-in debugger for JavaScript and Node.js applications. It allows developers to set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, view call stacks, and analyze the flow of execution. This is particularly useful for debugging complex applications, whether they run in a Node.js environment or in the browser.

#### Key Features of VS Code Debugger:
1. **Breakpoints**: Pause the execution of the code at specific lines.
2. **Stepping**: Step over, step into, or step out of functions to inspect program flow.
3. **Watch Variables**: Track specific variables and their changes in real-time.
4. **Call Stack**: See the sequence of function calls that led to a particular line of execution.
5. **Debug Console**: Execute JavaScript expressions within the current scope.
6. **Integrated with Node.js**: Directly debug Node.js apps with minimal setup.

---

### Setting up the VS Code Debugger for Node.js

1. **Basic Setup:**
   Create a `launch.json` file by going to the Debug tab (left toolbar) and clicking on "create a launch.json file."
   
   Here’s a basic configuration for a Node.js app:
   
   ```json
   {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
           {
               "type": "node",
               "request": "launch",
               "name": "Launch Program",
               "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
               "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
   - **`type`:** Defines the debugger type (`node` for Node.js).
   - **`request`:** `launch` starts a new instance of Node.js, while `attach` connects to an existing instance.
   - **`program`:** Specifies the entry point to the Node.js application.

2. **Running the Debugger:**
   After setting up `launch.json`, press `F5` or click the green play button in the Debug pane. VS Code will launch the application and attach the debugger.

3. **Setting Breakpoints:**
   - You can click on the left margin next to the line number where you want to pause the execution. A red dot will appear to mark the breakpoint.
   - Breakpoints can also be conditional, meaning they pause execution only when certain conditions are met (right-click the breakpoint > "Edit Breakpoint").

4. **Inspecting Variables:**
   - Once the code is paused at a breakpoint, you can hover over variables to inspect their values.
   - You can also view local and global variables in the “Variables” section of the Debug panel.

5. **Stepping Through Code:**
   - **Step Over (`F10`)**: Moves to the next line in the current function.
   - **Step Into (`F11`)**: Moves into any function calls on the current line.
   - **Step Out (`Shift+F11`)**: Moves out of the current function back to the calling function.

6. **Debug Console:**
   - The Debug Console allows you to run JavaScript commands and expressions in the current scope. For example, if the code is paused, you can type a variable name or any expression to see its value.

---

### Example: Debugging a Node.js Application

```js
// app.js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    let result = a + b;
    console.log('Result:', result);
    return result;
}

const x = 5;
const y = 10;
const sum = calculateSum(x, y);
```

Steps:
1. Set a breakpoint at `let result = a + b;`.
2. Run the debugger (`F5`).
3. When execution stops at the breakpoint, hover over `a` and `b` to see their values.
4. Use the "Step Over" command to move to the next line.
5. Check the value of `result` in the Variables pane.
6. Inspect the output in the Debug Console.

3) Sending Emails in Node.js:
### Sending Emails in Node.js: Overview

Sending emails from a Node.js application is common for tasks such as notifications, password resets, or confirmations. The most popular and widely used package for sending emails in Node.js is **Nodemailer**. It allows you to connect to SMTP servers (like Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) or even use services like SendGrid or Amazon SES to send emails.

#### Key Components:
1. **SMTP**: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is the protocol used to send emails across the internet.
2. **Nodemailer**: A Node.js library that simplifies sending emails.
3. **Transporter**: Defines how the email will be sent (e.g., via SMTP, service provider, etc.).

---

### Setting up Nodemailer in Node.js

#### 1. **Installation**
First, install the `nodemailer` package via npm:
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

#### 2. **Basic Example: Sending an Email**

Here’s how to send a simple email using Gmail’s SMTP server:

```js
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Create a transporter object using SMTP transport
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail', // You can use other services like 'yahoo', 'hotmail', etc.
    auth: {
        user: 'your-email@gmail.com', // Your Gmail address
        pass: 'your-email-password'   // Your Gmail password
    }
});

// Set up email data
const mailOptions = {
    from: 'your-email@gmail.com',      // Sender address
    to: 'recipient@example.com',       // List of receivers
    subject: 'Hello from Node.js!',    // Subject line
    text: 'This is a test email sent from Node.js using Nodemailer!', // Plain text body
    html: '<b>This is a test email sent from Node.js using Nodemailer!</b>' // HTML body
};

// Send the email
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
    if (error) {
        return console.log('Error occurred: ', error);
    }
    console.log('Email sent: %s', info.messageId);
});
```

#### 3. **Using Environment Variables**

For security, it’s best to store sensitive information like email credentials in environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
```

```js
require('dotenv').config(); // To load environment variables

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
        user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
        pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
    }
});
```

---

### Sending Emails via External Providers

1. **SendGrid**: 
   SendGrid is a popular service for sending transactional emails.

   ```bash
   npm install @sendgrid/mail
   ```

   ```js
   const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
   sgMail.setApiKey('your-sendgrid-api-key');
   
   const msg = {
       to: 'recipient@example.com',
       from: 'your-email@example.com',
       subject: 'Hello from SendGrid!',
       text: 'This is a test email sent using SendGrid!',
       html: '<strong>This is a test email sent using SendGrid!</strong>',
   };
   
   sgMail.send(msg).then(() => {
       console.log('Email sent successfully');
   }).catch((error) => {
       console.error('Error sending email: ', error);
   });
   ```

2. **Amazon SES**: 
   Amazon’s Simple Email Service can be used for large-scale email delivery.
   
   You would use the AWS SDK along with SES to configure the email sending process.

4) Events in Node.js:
### Events in Node.js: Overview

Node.js has a built-in event-driven architecture. It is heavily based on the **Observer pattern**, where an event emitter (subject) emits events, and listeners (observers) respond to those events. The core of this event system is the **EventEmitter** class, which is part of the `events` module.

#### Event-Driven Model:
- Node.js operates on a non-blocking, asynchronous model, and events play a key role in this.
- The event loop handles asynchronous callbacks, and events are emitted to signal that an operation has completed or that something significant has occurred.

---

### Using EventEmitter in Node.js

1. **Import the `events` module** and create an instance of `EventEmitter`.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
```

2. **Listening for Events**: You can register a listener (callback function) for a specific event using the `.on()` method.

```js
eventEmitter.on('eventName', () => {
    console.log('eventName has occurred!');
});
```

3. **Emitting Events**: To trigger the event, use the `.emit()` method.

```js
eventEmitter.emit('eventName');
```

4. **Passing Arguments to Listeners**: You can pass arguments to the listener when emitting an event.

```js
eventEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

eventEmitter.emit('greet', 'Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

5. **Multiple Listeners**: You can register multiple listeners for the same event.

```js
eventEmitter.on('data', () => {
    console.log('First listener executed.');
});

eventEmitter.on('data', () => {
    console.log('Second listener executed.');
});

eventEmitter.emit('data');
```

6. **One-Time Listeners**: Use `.once()` to register a listener that is called only once.

```js
eventEmitter.once('onceEvent', () => {
    console.log('This event listener is called only once.');
});

eventEmitter.emit('onceEvent');
eventEmitter.emit('onceEvent'); // The listener won't be triggered this time.
```

---

### Example: Simple EventEmitter in Node.js

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Listener for 'start' event
eventEmitter.on('start', () => {
    console.log('The start event has been triggered!');
});

// Emit the 'start' event
eventEmitter.emit('start');
```

---

### Extending EventEmitter

In most cases, you'll want to extend `EventEmitter` in your own class, especially when creating custom objects that emit events.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

// Registering an event listener
myEmitter.on('action', () => {
    console.log('An action event has occurred!');
});

// Trigger the event
myEmitter.emit('action');
```

---

### Error Handling in Event Emitters

If an error occurs and there are no listeners for the `'error'` event, Node.js will throw an error and crash the program. To prevent this, always attach an error handler.

```js
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

eventEmitter.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Error occurred:', err);
});

eventEmitter.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong!'));
```

---

### Interview Questions with Brief Answers:

1. **What is an event in Node.js?**
   - An event is a signal that something has happened in the application. Node.js uses an event-driven model to handle asynchronous operations.

2. **What is the `EventEmitter` class in Node.js?**
   - `EventEmitter` is a class in the `events` module that allows objects to emit named events and register listeners to respond to those events.

3. **How do you emit an event in Node.js?**
   - Use the `.emit()` method on an `EventEmitter` object to trigger an event.

4. **What is the difference between `.on()` and `.once()` in the EventEmitter class?**
   - `.on()` registers a listener that will be called every time the event is emitted, while `.once()` registers a listener that is called only the first time the event is emitted.

5. **Can you pass arguments when emitting an event in Node.js?**
   - Yes, arguments can be passed to event listeners when an event is emitted.

6. **What happens if an error event is emitted without an error handler?**
   - If no error handler is registered and an `'error'` event is emitted, Node.js will throw an unhandled error and terminate the program.

7. **What is the role of the event loop in Node.js?**
   - The event loop is responsible for managing asynchronous operations in Node.js. It continuously checks for tasks (such as events or callbacks) that are ready to be executed.

8. **How do you remove a specific event listener in Node.js?**
   - You can use `.off()` (or `.removeListener()`) to remove a specific listener from an event.

9. **How do you remove all listeners for a specific event?**
   - Use the `.removeAllListeners()` method to remove all listeners for a particular event.

10. **What is the `newListener` event in Node.js?**
    - The `newListener` event is emitted whenever a new listener is added to an event.

11. **Can you use EventEmitter to manage asynchronous operations?**
    - Yes, you can use events to handle asynchronous tasks, signaling completion or errors using custom events.

12. **How do you avoid memory leaks when using EventEmitters?**
    - Ensure that you remove listeners when they are no longer needed, especially for one-time or dynamic listeners.

13. **How does EventEmitter handle multiple listeners for the same event?**
    - All registered listeners for a given event will be called in the order they were added.

14. **What is the maximum number of listeners for a single event in Node.js, and can it be changed?**
    - By default, the maximum is 10 listeners. This limit can be changed using the `.setMaxListeners()` method.

15. **What are some real-world examples where EventEmitter is used in Node.js?**
    - EventEmitter is used for handling file system operations, HTTP request and response objects, and streams.

5) Testing API using Postman:
### Testing APIs Using Postman: Overview

Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs, particularly RESTful APIs. It allows developers to simulate HTTP requests to their APIs, test various endpoints, validate responses, and automate testing scenarios. It's widely used for manual and automated testing of APIs during development and debugging.

---

### Steps to Test an API with Postman

#### 1. **Install Postman**
- You can download and install Postman from [Postman's official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
  
#### 2. **Set Up Postman**
- Open Postman after installation. You can either sign in or use it without an account.

#### 3. **Sending a Simple Request**
- **Select HTTP Method**: Choose one of the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.).
- **Enter the API URL**: In the input field, type the API URL (for example, `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` for testing).
  
Example of a simple **GET** request:
- Method: `GET`
- URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`

Click **Send** to see the response.

#### 4. **Adding Parameters**
- You can add **query parameters** directly in the URL (e.g., `?id=1`) or via Postman’s UI under the "Params" tab.
  
#### 5. **Adding Headers**
- Sometimes APIs require headers like authentication tokens or content types. You can add these under the "Headers" tab.

Example headers:
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Authorization: Bearer yourTokenHere`

#### 6. **Sending a POST Request**
A `POST` request is used to send data to the server.

Example:
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- **Body**: Click the "Body" tab, select "raw", and choose "JSON". Then add the JSON payload:

```json
{
  "title": "foo",
  "body": "bar",
  "userId": 1
}
```

Click **Send** to send the request, and you should receive a response with the newly created resource.

---

### Example of Testing CRUD Operations with Postman

Let’s say you have an API with the following CRUD operations:

1. **GET** `/users` - Retrieve all users.
2. **POST** `/users` - Create a new user.
3. **PUT** `/users/:id` - Update a user.
4. **DELETE** `/users/:id` - Delete a user.

Here’s how you would test them in Postman:

#### 1. **GET Request**

- Method: `GET`
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/users`

Click **Send** to retrieve a list of all users.

#### 2. **POST Request**

- Method: `POST`
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/users`
- **Body**: 
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

Click **Send** to create a new user. The response should include the newly created user.

#### 3. **PUT Request**

- Method: `PUT`
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/users/1`
- **Body**: 
```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com"
}
```

Click **Send** to update the user with ID `1`. The response should reflect the updated data.

#### 4. **DELETE Request**

- Method: `DELETE`
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/users/1`

Click **Send** to delete the user with ID `1`. The response should confirm the deletion.

---

### Testing Authentication with Postman

If your API requires **authentication** (e.g., via a token), you can add the necessary token in the **Authorization** tab.

1. **Bearer Token Authentication**:
   - Go to the "Authorization" tab.
   - Select "Bearer Token" from the type dropdown.
   - Paste your token in the token field.
   - Postman will add the `Authorization: Bearer yourToken` header automatically to your request.

2. **Basic Authentication**:
   - In the "Authorization" tab, choose "Basic Auth" and provide your username and password.

---

### Automating Tests in Postman

Postman allows you to write JavaScript code to automate testing of API responses.

1. **Test Scripts**: In the **Tests** tab, you can write scripts to validate the response.
   
Example Test Script:

```js
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response has name field", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.jsonBody('name');
});
```

After sending a request, Postman will automatically run these tests, and you can see the results in the "Test Results" tab.

---

### Postman Collections for Organizing Requests

Postman collections allow you to group and organize requests.

1. **Create a Collection**: Click the **New** button and select **Collection**.
2. **Add Requests**: You can save individual requests to the collection for reuse.
3. **Run Collections**: Use the **Collection Runner** to run all the requests in a collection sequentially.

---

### Mocking APIs with Postman

If your backend isn’t fully developed yet, you can mock APIs with Postman.

1. **Create a Mock Server**: In Postman, click on **Mock Server** and define a new server with routes.
2. **Set Mock Responses**: Define what the mock server should return for each endpoint (status code, headers, body).

---

6)Creating Custom Events in Node.js:
### Creating Custom Events in Node.js

In Node.js, custom events are created using the `EventEmitter` class, which is part of the built-in `events` module. By leveraging this, you can emit and listen for custom events in your application.

---

### Steps to Create Custom Events

1. **Import the `events` module**.
2. **Create an instance** of `EventEmitter`.
3. **Register a listener** for your custom event using `.on()` or `.once()`.
4. **Emit the custom event** using `.emit()`.

---

### Example: Creating and Handling Custom Events

```js
// Step 1: Import the 'events' module
const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Step 2: Create an instance of EventEmitter
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Step 3: Register a listener for a custom event
eventEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Step 4: Emit the custom event
eventEmitter.emit('greet', 'Alice');
```

**Explanation**:
- In this example, we create a custom event called `'greet'`.
- A listener is registered to listen for the `greet` event and log a greeting message to the console when it's triggered.
- The event is emitted using the `.emit()` method, and `"Alice"` is passed as an argument to the event handler.

---

### Example: Emitting an Event After an Asynchronous Task

Let’s say you want to emit an event after reading a file or making an API request:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
const fs = require('fs');

// Register a custom event listener for 'fileRead'
eventEmitter.on('fileRead', (fileContent) => {
    console.log('File content:', fileContent);
});

// Perform an async task and emit the event
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Emit the custom event after file read
    eventEmitter.emit('fileRead', data);
});
```

**Explanation**:
- A custom event `'fileRead'` is emitted after successfully reading a file.
- The content of the file is passed to the event listener as an argument.

---

### Extending EventEmitter to Create Custom Objects with Events

In real-world applications, you often extend `EventEmitter` to add event capabilities to custom objects:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyClass extends EventEmitter {
    doSomething() {
        console.log('Doing something...');
        // Emit a custom event
        this.emit('done', 'Task complete');
    }
}

const myInstance = new MyClass();

// Register a listener for the 'done' event
myInstance.on('done', (message) => {
    console.log(message);
});

// Call the method that triggers the event
myInstance.doSomething();
```

**Explanation**:
- The `MyClass` class extends `EventEmitter`, so it can emit custom events.
- The `doSomething()` method performs an action and emits the `'done'` event with a message.

---

### Removing Event Listeners

To remove event listeners when they are no longer needed, you can use `.removeListener()` or `.off()`.

Example:

```js
function onResponse() {
    console.log('Response received!');
}

eventEmitter.on('response', onResponse);

// Emit the event (listener gets called)
eventEmitter.emit('response');

// Remove the listener
eventEmitter.off('response', onResponse);

// Emit again (listener does not get called)
eventEmitter.emit('response');
```

---

### One-Time Event Listeners

If you only want a listener to respond to an event once, you can use `.once()` instead of `.on()`:

```js
eventEmitter.once('start', () => {
    console.log('The start event was triggered.');
});

// Emit 'start' event (listener is called)
eventEmitter.emit('start');

// Emit 'start' again (listener is not called)
eventEmitter.emit('start');
```

---

### Handling Errors in Event Emitters

If an error event is emitted and no listener is registered, Node.js will throw an unhandled error and the process will terminate. It is important to handle errors explicitly by registering an error listener:

```js
eventEmitter.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Error occurred:', err.message);
});

// Emit an error event
eventEmitter.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong!'));
```

### Practical Example: User Registration and Custom Events

Imagine a user registration system where, after a user registers, you want to send a welcome email and log the registration event.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class UserRegistration extends EventEmitter {
    registerUser(username) {
        console.log(`Registering user: ${username}`);
        // Emit a 'userRegistered' event after registering the user
        this.emit('userRegistered', username);
    }
}

const userRegistration = new UserRegistration();

// Register listeners for custom events
userRegistration.on('userRegistered', (username) => {
    console.log(`Welcome email sent to ${username}`);
});

userRegistration.on('userRegistered', (username) => {
    console.log(`Log entry created for user: ${username}`);
});

// Trigger the custom event by registering a user
userRegistration.registerUser('JohnDoe');
```

### Interview Questions with Brief Answers:

1. **What is the `EventEmitter` class in Node.js?**
   - `EventEmitter` is a class in Node.js that facilitates creating and managing custom events. Objects from this class can emit events and have listeners that respond to those events.

2. **How do you create a custom event in Node.js?**
   - Use the `EventEmitter` class to create a custom event by emitting the event using `.emit()` and listening for it using `.on()` or `.once()`.

3. **How do you pass arguments to a custom event listener?**
   - When emitting an event, pass arguments to `.emit()`, and they will be available in the event listener.

4. **How can you remove an event listener in Node.js?**
   - Use `.off()` or `.removeListener()` to remove a specific listener for an event.

5. **What is the difference between `.on()` and `.once()`?**
   - `.on()` registers a listener that is called every time the event is emitted, whereas `.once()` registers a listener that is called only once for the first emission.

6. **What happens if you emit an error event without a listener?**
   - If an error event is emitted without an error listener, Node.js will throw an unhandled exception and terminate the process.

7. **Can you emit an event from within another event's listener?**
   - Yes, you can emit events from inside another listener. However, be mindful of performance and potential recursion issues.

8. **What is the maximum number of listeners allowed by default in Node.js?**
   - The default maximum is 10 listeners per event. You can increase or decrease this limit using `.setMaxListeners()`.

9. **What is the `newListener` event in Node.js?**
   - The `newListener` event is emitted whenever a new listener is added to an event.

10. **Why is it important to remove event listeners in long-running applications?**
    - To prevent memory leaks and improve performance, especially if listeners are no longer needed or get registered repeatedly in a dynamic environment.

========================= 4.Getting started with express =========================
1) middleware in express:
### Middleware in Express

**Middleware** functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware can execute code, make changes to the request or response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function.

#### Types of Middleware:
1. **Application-level**: Defined using `app.use()`, it applies to the entire app or certain routes.
2. **Router-level**: Attached to specific route handlers.
3. **Error-handling middleware**: Functions that handle errors within the app.
4. **Built-in middleware**: Middleware that comes with Express (like `express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`).
5. **Third-party middleware**: Middleware from third-party libraries (like `morgan`, `body-parser`).

#### Example:
Here’s a simple example of middleware in an Express app:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Application-level middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});

// Route-specific middleware
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
  next();
}, (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});

// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### 15 Interview Questions (with brief answers):

1. **What is middleware in Express?**
   - Middleware is a function that handles requests, processes data, and can call the next function or end the response cycle.

2. **How do you define middleware in Express?**
   - Middleware is defined using `app.use()` or directly in route methods such as `app.get()`, `app.post()`.

3. **What are the arguments of a middleware function?**
   - A middleware function takes three arguments: `req` (request), `res` (response), and `next` (a callback function to proceed to the next middleware).

4. **What is the role of `next()` in middleware?**
   - The `next()` function passes control to the next middleware function. Without it, the request-response cycle may halt.

5. **How can you use middleware for authentication in Express?**
   - Middleware can inspect the `req` object for tokens or session information to validate the user and proceed based on the authentication result.

6. **What is the difference between global middleware and route-specific middleware?**
   - Global middleware applies to all requests, while route-specific middleware applies to individual routes.

7. **How can you apply middleware to specific routes in Express?**
   - You can attach middleware functions directly to routes like: `app.get('/path', middlewareFunc, handlerFunc)`.

8. **What is error-handling middleware in Express?**
   - Middleware designed to catch errors in the app; it requires four parameters: `err`, `req`, `res`, `next`.

9. **How can you implement third-party middleware in Express?**
   - Install the package via npm, and use `app.use()` to integrate it into your app (e.g., `app.use(require('morgan')('tiny'));`).

10. **Can middleware send a response?**
    - Yes, middleware can either send a response and end the cycle or call `next()` to pass control to another middleware.

11. **What is `express.json()` middleware used for?**
    - It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on `body-parser`.

12. **How do you apply middleware to handle CORS in Express?**
    - By using third-party middleware like `cors`, which handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing rules.

13. **Explain middleware chaining.**
    - Middleware functions can be chained by calling `next()`, where each middleware in the chain performs an action.

14. **What happens if `next()` is not called in middleware?**
    - The request-response cycle gets stuck, and the client will not receive a response unless another middleware sends it.

15. **What is body-parser middleware?**
    - A popular middleware that parses incoming request bodies before they reach the route handlers. It’s included as part of Express in the form of `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`.

### 15 Tricky Challenges/Questions:

1. How can you conditionally skip certain middleware based on the request?

14. Write middleware to ensure HTTPS requests or redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
15. How do you implement middleware that applies different actions based on request headers?

2) Static in express:
### Static Files in Express

In Express, serving static files (like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files) can be easily handled using built-in middleware `express.static`. Static files are typically stored in a public directory, and Express serves them automatically when requested.

#### Setting Up Static Middleware:

- **Static Middleware**: This middleware serves static files and can be defined using the `express.static()` function. Once configured, files in the specified directory are served by their relative path.

#### Example:
Let’s assume you have a folder `public` with some static assets like stylesheets, JavaScript, and images. Here’s how you can serve those files in Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the "public" directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

- **Directory Structure**:
  ```
  my-app/
  ├── public/
  │   ├── css/
  │   │   └── styles.css
  │   ├── js/
  │   │   └── script.js
  │   └── images/
  │       └── logo.png
  └── app.js
  ```

In this case, the `public` folder will be the root from which the files will be served. You can access the files like so:
- `/css/styles.css`
- `/js/script.js`
- `/images/logo.png`

#### Customizing the Static Path:
You can set a different base path for the static files by providing a mount path:

```javascript
app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```

Now, files will be accessible at `/static/css/styles.css`, `/static/js/script.js`, etc.

### 15 Interview Questions (with brief answers):

1. **How do you serve static files in Express?**
   - Using the built-in `express.static()` middleware to serve files from a directory.

2. **What kind of files are considered static?**
   - Static files include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, and other resources that don’t change on the server side.

3. **How can you specify multiple static directories in Express?**
   - You can call `app.use()` multiple times with different directories:  
     ```javascript
     app.use(express.static('public'));
     app.use(express.static('assets'));
     ```

4. **What is the default path for static files in Express?**
   - There’s no default path until you configure `express.static()`. Typically, a folder like `public` is used.

5. **Can static middleware serve files from a URL path?**
   - Yes, you can specify a virtual path to serve files from a different URL, e.g., `/static`.

6. **What does `path.join(__dirname, 'public')` do?**
   - It joins the current directory path (`__dirname`) with the `public` folder, ensuring a correct file path is formed regardless of the operating system.

7. **Can you serve static files without `express.static()`?**
   - No, Express doesn’t natively serve static files without the `express.static()` middleware or another custom middleware.

8. **How can you restrict static file serving to certain file types?**
   - Use a custom middleware before `express.static()` to filter requests or inspect file types.

9. **What happens if a file is not found in the static directory?**
   - Express will return a 404 error if the requested file doesn’t exist.

10. **How do you cache static files for better performance?**
    - Browsers automatically cache static files, but you can control the cache behavior by setting appropriate HTTP headers, like `Cache-Control`.

11. **Can you serve different types of static files from different routes?**
    - Yes, you can mount different static directories to specific routes:
      ```javascript
      app.use('/images', express.static('img'));
      app.use('/css', express.static('styles'));
      ```

12. **How do you handle versioning or cache busting in static files?**
    - You can add query strings or version numbers in the file path (e.g., `/js/script.js?v=2`) to force the browser to load a new version.

13. **Can `express.static()` middleware compress files?**
    - No, you need to use additional middleware like `compression` to compress static files.

14. **How do you secure static files in Express?**
    - You can restrict access to certain directories or use authentication middleware before serving files.

15. **How do you serve static files over HTTPS?**
    - You need to set up HTTPS with Express (using `https` module or Nginx) and then serve static files as usual with `express.static()`.

### 15 Tricky Challenges/Questions:

1. How would you add middleware to log requests only for static files?
2. Create middleware to serve static files but apply different caching rules for different file types.
3. How would you serve static files only to authenticated users?
4. Can you serve static files conditionally, e.g., only during development?
5. How would you handle static file versioning in Express for different environments (e.g., dev vs prod)?
6. Can you use middleware to sanitize file paths before serving static files?
7. How do you handle serving large static files in Express efficiently?
8. Write middleware to deny access to certain static files (like config files) from being served.
9. How would you apply compression specifically to static files, without affecting other routes?
10. Implement a mechanism to monitor and log failed requests for static files.
11. How can you serve static files from a remote server or a CDN using Express?
12. How can you set custom headers (e.g., security headers) for static files?
13. How do you manage hot-reloading of static assets in Express during development?
14. Can you serve gzipped versions of static files automatically?
15. How would you integrate a custom logging system for requests to static files in Express?


========================= 14.Javascript : (Promises and Asyc/Await )=========================
1) Promise in js:
### Brief on Promises in JavaScript

**Promises** in JavaScript are objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable way than traditional callbacks.

A promise can be in one of the following states:
- **Pending**: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation was completed successfully.
- **Rejected**: The operation failed.

When a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it will call the appropriate handler (provided with `.then()` or `.catch()`), allowing you to manage asynchronous operations effectively.

#### Example: Basic Usage of a Promise

```javascript
// Create a new Promise
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true; // Simulating success or failure

    if (success) {
        resolve("The operation was successful!");
    } else {
        reject("The operation failed.");
    }
});

// Handle the Promise
myPromise
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result); // Output: The operation was successful!
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error); // If the promise was rejected
    });
```

### 15 Interview Questions on Promises in JavaScript

1. **What is a Promise in JavaScript?**
   - *Answer*: A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

2. **Explain the states of a Promise.**
   - *Answer*: A promise can be in three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

3. **How do you create a Promise?**
   - *Answer*: A Promise is created using the `new Promise()` constructor, which takes a function with `resolve` and `reject` as arguments.

4. **What are `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` in Promises?**
   - *Answer*: `.then()` is used to handle fulfilled promises, `.catch()` is for handling rejections, and `.finally()` is executed regardless of the promise's outcome.

5. **Can you chain Promises? How?**
   - *Answer*: Yes, promises can be chained using `.then()` to handle the result of the previous promise and return a new promise.

6. **What happens if you don't handle a rejected Promise?**
   - *Answer*: If a rejected promise is not handled, it may cause unhandled promise rejections, which can lead to errors in the application.

7. **Explain the difference between callbacks and Promises.**
   - *Answer*: Promises provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks, which can lead to "callback hell."

8. **What is the purpose of `Promise.all()`?**
   - *Answer*: `Promise.all()` runs multiple promises in parallel and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved.
   
   ```// Simulating asynchronous tasks with Promises
const task1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 1 completed");
    }, 1000); // Task 1 takes 1 second
});

const task2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 2 completed");
    }, 2000); // Task 2 takes 2 seconds
});

const task3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 3 completed");
    }, 1500); // Task 3 takes 1.5 seconds
});

// Using Promise.all to wait for all tasks to complete
Promise.all([task1, task2, task3])
    .then(results => {
        console.log("All tasks completed:");
        console.log(results); // Output: ["Task 1 completed", "Task 3 completed", "Task 2 completed"]
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log("One of the tasks failed:", error);
    });```


9. **How does `Promise.race()` work?**
   - *Answer*: `Promise.race()` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the input promises resolves or rejects.
   
   ```// Simulating asynchronous tasks with Promises
const task1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 1 completed");
    }, 3000); // Task 1 takes 3 seconds
});

const task2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 2 completed");
    }, 2000); // Task 2 takes 2 seconds
});

const task3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        reject("Task 3 failed");
    }, 1000); // Task 3 takes 1 second and fails
});

// Using Promise.race to get the first settled promise
Promise.race([task1, task2, task3])
    .then(result => {
        console.log("First settled task:", result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log("First settled task failed:", error);
    });```


10. **What is a `Promise.resolve()`?**
    - *Answer*: `Promise.resolve()` creates a promise that is immediately resolved with the given value.

11. **What is `Promise.reject()`?**
    - *Answer*: `Promise.reject()` creates a promise that is immediately rejected with the given reason.

12. **How can you convert a callback-based function to return a Promise?**
    - *Answer*: You can wrap the callback function inside a `new Promise()` and call `resolve` or `reject` based on the callback’s outcome.

13. **What is an async function in JavaScript, and how does it relate to Promises?**
    - *Answer*: An async function returns a Promise and allows you to write asynchronous code using `await`, making it look synchronous.

14. **How would you handle multiple asynchronous operations that need to happen sequentially?**
    - *Answer*: You can chain promises using `.then()` to ensure that each operation happens after the previous one has completed.

15. **Explain the concept of "Promise chaining".**
    - *Answer*: Promise chaining is the process of linking multiple promise handlers in a sequence, where each `.then()` or `.catch()` passes its result to the next.

### 15 Tricky Challenges/Questions on Promises in JavaScript

14. **How would you handle errors in a chain of promises without stopping the entire chain?**

15. **Explain how to convert an array of callback-based functions into a chain of promises.**

2) Why promise status show fulfilled after it reject?

### Understanding the "Fulfilled" Status in the Console

When you inspect a promise in the browser's developer console, you might see something like this:

```javascript
Promise {<rejected>: "The operation failed."}
```

However, in the console, you might see the following structure when expanding the promise object:

```javascript
[[PromiseStatus]]: "fulfilled"
[[PromiseResult]]: "The operation failed."
```

This can be confusing, but here's what actually happens:

### Explanation

- **Promise Status in Console:**
  - The term "fulfilled" in the console doesn't refer to the success of the operation but rather indicates that the promise has "settled"—meaning it is no longer in the "pending" state. The promise has finished its execution and has either been resolved or rejected.
  - The `[[PromiseStatus]]` in the console reflects that the promise has finished processing, which is why it says "fulfilled." 

- **PromiseResult:**
  - The `[[PromiseResult]]` shows what the promise resolved or rejected with. In this case, it shows `"The operation failed."`, indicating that the promise was rejected.

- The console uses the term "fulfilled" to indicate that the promise has completed, regardless of whether it was resolved or rejected.
- To determine if a promise was rejected, you should look at the `[[PromiseResult]]` and see the value it holds. If it’s a rejection message, that confirms the promise was rejected.

3) How status changing during api call?
When an API call is made in JavaScript using promises, the underlying process involves several steps that handle the asynchronous nature of the operation. Understanding how the browser or JavaScript engine handles these steps can shed light on how it knows whether the operation is successful or has failed.

### 1. **Initiating the API Call**
   - When you use a method like `fetch()` to make an API call, the JavaScript engine sends an HTTP request to the specified server. This request is sent asynchronously, meaning it doesn't block the execution of other code.
   - At this point, a `Promise` object is created, and its initial state is `pending`.

### 2. **Event Loop and Web APIs**
   - The actual API call is handled by the browser's Web APIs (in a browser environment) or the event loop and libuv (in Node.js).
   - The JavaScript engine hands off the request to these lower-level systems, which manage the communication with the server. The promise remains in a `pending` state.

### 3. **Receiving the Response**
   - The server processes the request and sends back a response. This response could be a success (with data) or an error (like a 404 or 500 status code).
   - Once the response is received by the Web APIs or event loop, it's queued for processing by the JavaScript engine.

### 4. **Callback Queues and Microtasks**
   - Once the response is ready, a callback function associated with the `fetch()` method (or other similar methods) is placed in the **microtask queue**.
   - The event loop monitors both the **call stack** and the **microtask queue**. When the call stack is clear, the event loop picks the next microtask (which includes the callback from the `fetch()` response) to process.

### 5. **Promise Resolution**
   - The callback function associated with the promise (like `.then()` for success or `.catch()` for errors) is executed based on the nature of the response:
     - **If the response is successful** (status code 200-299), the `resolve()` function is called within the promise, changing its state from `pending` to `fulfilled`. The value (response data) is passed along as the promise's result.
     - **If the response fails** (status code outside 200-299, network error, etc.), the `reject()` function is called, changing the promise's state from `pending` to `rejected`. The error or rejection reason is passed along as the promise's result.

### 6. **Handling the Result**
   - The result of the promise (whether fulfilled or rejected) is then handled by the associated `.then()` or `.catch()` callbacks.
   - The JavaScript engine automatically updates the promise's state based on whether `resolve()` or `reject()` was called.

### Example Flow

```javascript
const apiCall = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Step 1: Initiating the API call
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            // Step 5a: If successful, resolve the promise
            if (response.ok) {
                return response.json();
            } else {
                // Step 5b: If not successful, reject the promise
                throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
            }
        })
        .then(data => {
            // Step 6a: Handle successful data
            resolve(data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            // Step 6b: Handle the error
            reject(error);
        });
});

// Usage
apiCall
    .then(data => console.log("Data received:", data))
    .catch(error => console.log("Failed to fetch data:", error));
```

### What Happens Internally

- **`fetch()` Execution:** The JavaScript engine offloads the HTTP request to the browser's Web API, and the promise is created with a `pending` state.
- **Response Handling:** Once the server responds, the browser's Web API or event loop schedules the response handler in the microtask queue.
- **Promise State Change:** The promise's state is updated based on whether the operation succeeded (`resolve()`) or failed (`reject()`).
- **Result Handling:** The appropriate callback (`.then()` or `.catch()`) is executed, handling the result of the promise.

### Conclusion

The JavaScript engine and its event loop, together with Web APIs or libuv (in Node.js), manage the asynchronous operation. The key lies in the `resolve()` and `reject()` functions within the `Promise` constructor, which the JavaScript engine automatically invokes based on the outcome of the asynchronous task. This is how the promise transitions from `pending` to `fulfilled` or `rejected`, and how it "knows" whether the operation succeeded or failed.

4) Event-looping:

The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows asynchronous operations to be processed without blocking the execution of other code. JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time in a single thread. However, with the help of the event loop, JavaScript can handle multiple operations efficiently, giving the illusion of multitasking.

#### How the Event Loop Works

1. **Call Stack:**
   - The call stack is a data structure that tracks the execution of functions. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the stack.

2. **Web APIs:**
   - In a browser environment, Web APIs (like `setTimeout`, `DOM events`, `fetch`, etc.) handle tasks asynchronously. These tasks are offloaded to the Web APIs, freeing up the call stack to continue executing other code.

3. **Callback Queue (Task Queue):**
   - Once an asynchronous task (like a `setTimeout` or an API call) is completed, its callback function is added to the callback queue.

4. **Event Loop:**
   - The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, the event loop picks the next function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

5. **Microtask Queue:**
   - Promises and some other operations are handled using the microtask queue, which has a higher priority than the callback queue. Microtasks are processed right after the currently executing task completes and before the event loop moves on to the next task in the callback queue.

#### Visualizing the Event Loop

Here's a simplified diagram:

```
+-------------------+
|    Call Stack     | <-- Executes one task at a time
+-------------------+
        |
        v
+-------------------+
|  Web APIs/Threads | <-- Handles async operations like setTimeout, fetch, etc.
+-------------------+
        |
        v
+-------------------+          +-------------------+
|  Callback Queue   | <----+   |  Microtask Queue  | <-- Higher priority
+-------------------+      |   +-------------------+
        |                  |
        v                  |
+-------------------+      |
|   Event Loop      | <----+
+-------------------+
```

#### Example: Understanding the Event Loop

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("Promise callback");
});

console.log("End");
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Start
End
Promise callback
Timeout callback
```

**Explanation:**
1. `console.log("Start")` is executed first and logged to the console.
2. `setTimeout()` is called, but its callback is added to the callback queue after 0 milliseconds. This doesn't run immediately because it's handled by the Web APIs and then added to the callback queue.
3. The promise is resolved immediately, and its `.then()` callback is added to the microtask queue.
4. `console.log("End")` is executed and logged to the console.
5. The event loop finds the call stack empty and processes the microtask queue first, executing the promise callback (`Promise callback`).
6. Finally, the event loop picks the `setTimeout` callback from the callback queue and executes it (`Timeout callback`).

### Interview Questions on Event Loop

1. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**
   - **Answer:** The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite being single-threaded. It continuously checks the call stack and callback/microtask queues to manage the execution of functions.

2. **How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations with the event loop?**
   - **Answer:** JavaScript uses the event loop to offload asynchronous operations to the Web APIs or Node.js's libuv, which manage these operations. Once completed, the event loop processes their callbacks in the appropriate queue.

3. **What is the difference between the callback queue and the microtask queue?**
   - **Answer:** The microtask queue (for promises and other microtasks) has higher priority and is processed before the callback queue (for `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, etc.).

4. **Why is the output of the following code `1, 3, 2`?**
   ```javascript
   console.log(1);
   setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);
   console.log(3);
   ```
   - **Answer:** The `setTimeout` callback is added to the callback queue and only executed after the call stack is empty. Hence, `1` and `3` are logged first, followed by `2`.

5. **Can you explain what happens when a promise is resolved?**
   - **Answer:** When a promise is resolved, its `.then()` callback is added to the microtask queue. The event loop processes this queue before moving on to the callback queue.

6. **What is the significance of the event loop in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** In Node.js, the event loop is crucial for handling I/O operations, allowing the server to handle many connections simultaneously without blocking the execution of code.

### Tricky Challenges

1. **Predict the output:**
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
   console.log('sync');
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `sync`, `promise`, `timeout`

2. **Explain the behavior:**
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
   setImmediate(() => console.log('immediate'));
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** This depends on the environment (browser vs. Node.js).

3. **What will the following code output?**
   ```javascript
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise1'));
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise2'));
   console.log('sync');
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `sync`, `promise1`, `promise2`

4. **Describe the output and order of execution:**
   ```javascript
   process.nextTick(() => console.log('tick'));
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
   setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `tick`, `promise`, `timeout`

5. **Why does this code output `1, 4, 3, 2`?**
   ```javascript
   console.log(1);
   setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 1000);
   setTimeout(() => console.log(3), 0);
   console.log(4);
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `1`, `4`, `3`, `2`

6. **What is the purpose of `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** It defers the execution of a function until the current operation completes, but before the event loop continues.

5) Prototype chaining:

Prototype chaining is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that enables objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This mechanism is essential for implementing inheritance in JavaScript.

#### What is Prototype Chaining?

Prototype chaining refers to the ability of objects to delegate property and method lookups to their prototype objects. When you access a property or method of an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If it doesn't find it there, it looks up the prototype chain, which is a series of prototypes that the object is linked to.

### Key Concepts

1. **Prototype:**
   - Every JavaScript object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]` (often accessed via `__proto__` in older code or via `Object.getPrototypeOf()`).
   - This prototype is itself an object, and it may have its own prototype, forming a chain.

2. **Prototype Chain:**
   - The prototype chain is a series of objects linked together. When a property or method is accessed, JavaScript traverses this chain to find the property or method.

3. **`Object.prototype`:**
   - At the top of every prototype chain is `Object.prototype`. If a property or method is not found on the object or its prototypes, JavaScript will check `Object.prototype`. If it's still not found, it returns `undefined`.

4. **Inheritance:**
   - Prototype chaining allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This mechanism is used to create inheritance hierarchies.

### Example of Prototype Chaining

```javascript
// Define a constructor function
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

// Add a method to the Animal prototype
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
};

// Define another constructor function
function Dog(name, breed) {
    Animal.call(this, name); // Call the parent constructor
    this.breed = breed;
}

// Set up prototype chaining
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Inherit from Animal
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog; // Set the constructor property

// Add a method to the Dog prototype
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
};

// Create instances
const dog = new Dog('Rex', 'German Shepherd');

// Access methods and properties
dog.speak(); // Inherited from Animal
dog.bark();  // Defined in Dog
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Animal Constructor Function:** Defines an `Animal` with a `name` and a `speak` method.
2. **Dog Constructor Function:** Inherits from `Animal` and adds its own property `breed` and method `bark`.
3. **Prototype Chain Setup:** `Dog.prototype` is set to an object created from `Animal.prototype`. This makes `Dog` inherit from `Animal`.
4. **Creating Instances:** `dog` is an instance of `Dog` and has access to both `speak` (inherited) and `bark` (own method).

### Understanding Prototype Chain Lookup

When you access `dog.speak()`, JavaScript performs the following steps:

1. **Check `dog`:** Look for the `speak` method directly on `dog`. It's not found.
2. **Check `Dog.prototype`:** Look for the `speak` method on `Dog.prototype`. It's not there.
3. **Check `Animal.prototype`:** Look for the `speak` method on `Animal.prototype`. It's found and executed.
4. **Check `Object.prototype`:** If the method were not found, JavaScript would check `Object.prototype`.

### Interview Questions on Prototype Chaining

1. **What is prototype chaining in JavaScript?**
   - **Answer:** Prototype chaining is the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from other objects through their prototype chain.

2. **How do you set up inheritance using prototype chaining?**
   - **Answer:** Inherit from a parent constructor by setting the prototype of the child constructor to an object created from the parent’s prototype, and set the child's prototype constructor to the child constructor.

3. **What is the role of `Object.create()` in prototype chaining?**
   - **Answer:** `Object.create()` creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties, allowing for easy setup of inheritance.

4. **Explain how `Object.prototype` fits into prototype chaining.**
   - **Answer:** `Object.prototype` is at the end of every prototype chain. If a property or method is not found on the object or its prototypes, JavaScript checks `Object.prototype`.

5. **How can you access an object's prototype?**
   - **Answer:** You can access an object's prototype using `Object.getPrototypeOf(object)` or `object.__proto__` (though the latter is deprecated).

### Tricky Challenges

1. **What will be the output of this code?**
   ```javascript
   function Animal() {}
   Animal.prototype.sound = 'roar';
   const animal = new Animal();
   console.log(animal.sound); // 'roar'
   Animal.prototype.sound = 'growl';
   console.log(animal.sound); // 'growl'
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `roar`, `growl`

2. **Describe the output:**
   ```javascript
   function Parent() {}
   function Child() {}
   Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
   Child.prototype.constructor = Child;

   const instance = new Child();
   console.log(instance instanceof Child); // true
   console.log(instance instanceof Parent); // true
   console.log(instance instanceof Object); // true
   ```

3. **Explain why the following code outputs `true` and `false`:**
   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
       this.name = name;
   }

   Person.prototype.greet = function() {
       return 'Hello, ' + this.name;
   };

   const p = new Person('John');
   console.log(p.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
   console.log(p.__proto__.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
   ```

4. **What will be the output of this code and why?**
   ```javascript
   function Animal() {}
   Animal.prototype = { sound: 'roar' };
   const animal = new Animal();
   console.log(animal.sound); // 'roar'
   Animal.prototype.sound = 'growl';
   console.log(animal.sound); // 'roar'
   ```

5. **Explain why this code results in an error:**
   ```javascript
   function Parent() {}
   Parent.prototype.method = function() {};
   function Child() {}
   Child.prototype = Parent.prototype;
   const child = new Child();
   child.method = function() {};
   console.log(new Parent().method); // Function() {}
   ```

Prototype chaining is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows for efficient inheritance and property sharing. Understanding how it works is essential for mastering JavaScript's object-oriented programming capabilities.

6) Predefined Promises:
Certainly! JavaScript provides several built-in (or predefined) promises and functions that return promises. These are particularly useful for handling asynchronous operations. Here’s a list of some common predefined promises and promise-related functions in JavaScript:

### 1. **`Promise.resolve(value)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that is resolved with the given value.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const promise = Promise.resolve('Resolved value');
     promise.then(value => console.log(value)); // Output: 'Resolved value'
     ```

### 2. **`Promise.reject(reason)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const promise = Promise.reject(new Error('Rejected reason'));
     promise.catch(error => console.log(error.message)); // Output: 'Rejected reason'
     ```

### 3. **`Promise.all(iterable)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable have resolved or rejects if any of the promises reject.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
     const p2 = Promise.resolve(2);
     const p3 = Promise.resolve(3);

     Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
       .then(values => console.log(values)); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
     ```

### 4. **`Promise.allSettled(iterable)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either resolved or rejected, with an array of objects describing the outcome of each promise.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
     const p2 = Promise.reject(new Error('Failed'));
     const p3 = Promise.resolve(3);

     Promise.allSettled([p1, p2, p3])
       .then(results => console.log(results));
     // Output: [{ status: 'fulfilled', value: 1 }, { status: 'rejected', reason: Error: Failed }, { status: 'fulfilled', value: 3 }]
     ```

### 5. **`Promise.any(iterable)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that resolves as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves, or rejects if no promises in the iterable resolve.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p1 = Promise.reject('Fail 1');
     const p2 = Promise.resolve('Success');
     const p3 = Promise.reject('Fail 2');

     Promise.any([p1, p2, p3])
       .then(value => console.log(value)); // Output: 'Success'
     ```

### 6. **`Promise.race(iterable)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'First'));
     const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'Second'));

     Promise.race([p1, p2])
       .then(value => console.log(value)); // Output: 'Second'
     ```

### 7. **`Promise.resolve().then()`**
   - **Description:** A way to use the `Promise.resolve()` to immediately resolve a promise and schedule a callback to be executed asynchronously.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Executed asynchronously'));
     // Output: 'Executed asynchronously'
     ```

### 8. **`Promise.finally(onFinally)`**
   - **Description:** Adds a final callback that will be executed regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p = Promise.resolve('Done');

     p.then(value => console.log(value))
      .finally(() => console.log('Final block executed'));
     // Output: 'Done'
     // Output: 'Final block executed'
     ```

### Summary

These predefined promises and promise-related methods provide a robust set of tools for handling asynchronous operations and coordinating multiple promises in JavaScript. They are crucial for managing asynchronous workflows and ensuring predictable outcomes in modern JavaScript applications.

7) Async/Await:

`async` and `await` are syntactic sugars introduced in ES2017 (ES8) that make working with asynchronous code in JavaScript more straightforward and readable. They are built on top of Promises and provide a cleaner and more concise way to handle asynchronous operations.

### Key Concepts

1. **`async` Function:**
   - An `async` function is a function declared with the `async` keyword. It always returns a promise.
   - If the function returns a value, the promise is resolved with that value.
   - If the function throws an error, the promise is rejected with that error.

2. **`await` Expression:**
   - The `await` keyword can only be used inside `async` functions. It pauses the execution of the `async` function and waits for the promise to resolve or reject.
   - It then resumes the execution of the function and returns the resolved value or throws the rejected error.

### Syntax

#### Declaring an `async` Function

```javascript
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  // Function body
}
```

#### Using `await`

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}
```

### Example

Here’s a complete example demonstrating the use of `async` and `await`:

```javascript
// A function that simulates fetching data from an API
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Data fetched successfully!');
    }, 1000); // Simulate a delay
  });
}

// An async function that uses await to handle the promise
async function getData() {
  try {
    const result = await fetchData();
    console.log(result); // Output after 1 second: 'Data fetched successfully!'
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

// Call the async function
getData();
```

### Error Handling

Errors in `async` functions are handled using `try...catch` blocks, similar to synchronous code:

```javascript
async function example() {
  try {
    const result = await someAsyncOperation();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
```

### Parallel Execution

To run multiple asynchronous operations in parallel, use `Promise.all()`:

```javascript
async function fetchAll() {
  try {
    const [data1, data2] = await Promise.all([
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data1').then(response => response.json()),
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data2').then(response => response.json())
    ]);
    console.log(data1, data2);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}
```

### Summary

- **`async` Function:** A function that returns a promise. It makes asynchronous code look synchronous and easier to understand.
- **`await` Keyword:** Pauses the execution of an `async` function until the promise is settled, making it possible to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code.

### Interview Questions on Async/Await

1. **What is an `async` function in JavaScript?**
   - **Answer:** An `async` function is a function declared with the `async` keyword that always returns a promise. The function's return value is automatically wrapped in a promise.

2. **How does `await` work in an `async` function?**
   - **Answer:** The `await` keyword pauses the execution of an `async` function until the promise is settled and then resumes execution, returning the resolved value or throwing the rejected error.

3. **Can you use `await` outside of an `async` function?**
   - **Answer:** No, `await` can only be used inside `async` functions. It will cause a syntax error if used outside.

4. **What happens if you `await` a non-promise value?**
   - **Answer:** If you `await` a non-promise value, it will be treated as a resolved promise with that value. Essentially, `await` converts the value into a resolved promise.

5. **How do you handle errors in an `async` function?**
   - **Answer:** Errors in an `async` function are handled using `try...catch` blocks, similar to synchronous code.

### Tricky Challenges

1. **What is the output of this code?**
   ```javascript
   async function foo() {
     return 'Hello';
   }

   foo().then(console.log); // Output?
   ```

2. **Explain why this code might not behave as expected:**
   ```javascript
   async function getData() {
     const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
     console.log(data);
   }

   getData(); // Will this log the response object or the JSON data?
   ```

3. **Describe what happens in this code:**
   ```javascript
   async function example() {
     const result = await Promise.resolve('Done');
     console.log(result);
   }

   example();
   ```

4. **How do you execute multiple asynchronous tasks sequentially using `async`/`await`?**
   - **Answer:** Sequential execution can be achieved by awaiting each task in sequence:
     ```javascript
     async function sequentialTasks() {
       const result1 = await task1();
       const result2 = await task2(result1);
       console.log(result2);
     }
     ```

5. **What will this code output and why?**
   ```javascript
   async function foo() {
     return new Error('An error');
   }

   foo().then(console.log);
   ```
8) what is function suspension in js?
Function suspension refers to the ability to pause the execution of a function at a certain point and resume it later, maintaining its state between pauses. In JavaScript, this concept is primarily implemented using generator functions and the yield keyword.

========================= Project:- Inventory management Project==========================
1) MVC in Nodejs:-

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern used in software development, and it's especially common in web applications. It helps organize code into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. Here's how MVC works in Node.js:

### 1. **Model**
   - **Role**: Represents the data layer of the application. It defines the structure of the data, interacts with the database, and handles the business logic.
   - **Example in Node.js**: Using a model might involve defining a schema with Mongoose (if using MongoDB) or setting up SQL queries (if using a relational database).

### 2. **View**
   - **Role**: Represents the presentation layer. It defines how the data should be displayed to the user. In Node.js, views are often created using template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars.
   - **Example in Node.js**: An EJS template that renders HTML by injecting data from the model.

### 3. **Controller**
   - **Role**: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles the request from the user, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and then sends the appropriate data to the View for presentation.
   - **Example in Node.js**: A controller function that handles a specific route, retrieves data from the database through the Model, and renders the appropriate view.

### How it works together in Node.js:
- **Request Flow**: 
  1. A user sends a request (e.g., accessing a webpage).
  2. The **Controller** receives the request and processes it.
  3. The **Controller** interacts with the **Model** to retrieve or modify data.
  4. The **Model** returns the data to the **Controller**.
  5. The **Controller** passes the data to the **View**.
  6. The **View** generates the final HTML/CSS/JS that is sent back to the user.

### Example in Node.js (Inventory Management Project):
- **Model**: You might have a `Product` model that defines the structure for inventory items.
- **View**: You could have EJS templates that display the list of products, forms for adding new products, etc.
- **Controller**: You might have a `ProductController` that handles routes like `/products` (list products), `/products/add` (show form to add product), and `/products/:id` (view details of a specific product).

This separation of concerns makes your code more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. Since you’re working on an inventory management project with an MVC structure, each part of the project (data handling, user interface, and request logic) would be neatly organized in these three components.

2)Express in NodeJS:
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building web applications by providing tools and utilities for managing routes, handling requests and responses, middleware support, and more.

### Key Features of Express:
1. **Routing**:
   - Express allows you to define routes to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL paths.
   - For example, you can create routes for different parts of your application, such as `/home`, `/products`, or `/users`.

2. **Middleware**:
   - Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
   - Middleware can be used for tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, handling errors, etc.

3. **View Rendering**:
   - Express supports various template engines (like EJS, Pug, Handlebars) for generating HTML dynamically based on your data.
   - You can set up a view engine and render templates with dynamic content.

4. **HTTP Utility Methods**:
   - Express provides a set of HTTP utility methods to manage responses, such as setting headers, sending JSON data, sending status codes, and more.

5. **Static File Serving**:
   - You can easily serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript using the `express.static` middleware.

6. **Simple and Minimalistic**:
   - Express is unopinionated, meaning it doesn’t enforce a specific structure or way of doing things. You have the flexibility to organize your application as you see fit.

7. **Extensible**:
   - Express has a rich ecosystem of third-party middleware and plugins, allowing you to extend its functionality as needed.

### Basic Example of an Express Application:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route for the home page
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server and listen on a specific port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this example:
- `express()` creates an Express application.
- `app.get()` defines a route for the root URL (`/`) that sends "Hello, World!" as a response.
- `app.listen()` starts the server and listens on port 3000.

### Why Use Express?
- **Ease of Use**: Express abstracts away much of the boilerplate code involved in setting up a web server, making it quicker to develop applications.
- **Flexibility**: It allows you to build everything from simple static websites to complex, full-featured web applications.
- **Large Ecosystem**: The availability of middleware and extensions means you can easily add features like authentication, validation, logging, and more.
- **Compatibility**: It works well with various databases, templating engines, and other Node.js tools.

Express is widely used for building APIs, single-page applications (SPAs), web applications, and microservices.

3) Serving Static files:-

Serving static files refers to the process of delivering files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, and other assets directly to the client (usually a web browser) from the server without any server-side processing or logic. These files are "static" because they don't change dynamically based on the request; they are delivered as-is.

In the Context of Express.js:
In an Express.js application, serving static files is a common requirement. You typically want to make certain files (like your site's CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, images, etc.) accessible to users directly through the web server.

How to Serve Static Files in Express:
Express has a built-in middleware function called express.static() that makes it easy to serve static files. You just need to specify the directory where your static files are located, and Express will automatically handle requests for those files.

Here's how you can set up Express to serve these files:

```
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Serve static files from the "public" directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});```

***Benefits of Serving Static Files***:
Performance: Static files are delivered quickly because they don’t require server-side processing.
Simplicity: Static files are straightforward to manage and serve, making them ideal for assets that don’t need to change dynamically.
Efficiency: Reduces server load because the server doesn’t have to generate a response dynamically.

***Use Cases***:
Website Assets: CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts used by your website.
Downloadable Files: PDFs, documents, or any other file you want users to be able to download directly.
Client-Side Code: Files that are part of your frontend codebase, like React or Angular bundles.

4) Template Engine:
A template engine in Node.js is used to generate dynamic HTML by combining templates with data. Popular template engines include EJS, Pug, and Handlebars. They allow you to create reusable components and separate logic from presentation.

5) HTTP request logger:
An HTTP request logger is a middleware that logs details about incoming HTTP requests, such as the request method, URL, status code, and response time. This is useful for monitoring and debugging your application.i.e Morgan
