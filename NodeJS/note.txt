=================== 1. Getting started with node JS=======================
1) Defination:
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome. Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications, particularly those that require real-time interactions, such as chat applications, gaming servers, and collaborative tools.

2) Event-driven:
Event-driven architecture is a design where the flow of a program is controlled by events. An event can be anything from a user action, like a mouse click, to a message from another program.

### Key Points:

1. **Event**: Something that happens (e.g., a button click).
2. **Event Emitter**: The part that generates the event.
3. **Event Listener**: The part that waits for and responds to the event.
4. **Callback**: The function that runs when the event happens.

### How It Works:

1. **Listen**: You set up an event listener to wait for an event.
2. **Emit**: An event occurs, triggering the event emitter.
3. **Respond**: The listener detects the event and runs the callback function.

### Example:

In a web page:

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

In Node.js:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('An event occurred!');
});

emitter.emit('event');
```

### Pros:

- **Responsive**: Good for real-time applications.
- **Flexible**: Can handle many different events easily.

### Cons:

- **Complex**: Can become hard to manage with many events.
- **Performance**: Can be slower due to the overhead of handling events.


3) Pros and cons:
### Pros of Node.js:

1. **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
2. **Fast Performance**: The V8 engine compiles JavaScript to native machine code, making execution extremely fast.
3. **Single Programming Language**: Developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side scripting, leading to a more unified development experience.
4. **Rich Ecosystem**: With npm (Node Package Manager), Node.js has a vast library of packages and modules, which can significantly speed up development.
5. **Scalability**: Node.js is designed for scalability, supporting microservices and real-time applications.
6. **Large Community**: A large and active community provides support, tutorials, and shared resources, making it easier to find help and collaborate.
7. **Cross-Platform**: Node.js can run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing flexibility in deployment.

### Cons of Node.js:

1. **Single-Threaded Limitations**: Node.js is single-threaded, which can be a drawback for CPU-intensive tasks. While it handles I/O operations well, it may struggle with heavy computational tasks.
2. **Callback Hell**: The extensive use of callbacks can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code, often referred to as "callback hell." Promises and async/await have mitigated this issue to some extent.
3. **Maturity of Libraries**: Some npm packages may not be as mature or well-maintained as libraries in other ecosystems, leading to potential security risks or bugs.
4. **Error Handling**: Error handling in asynchronous code can be tricky and may require additional effort to manage effectively.
5. **Tooling and Debugging**: While tooling and debugging support has improved, it may not be as robust as in more established languages and frameworks.
6. **Concurrency Issues**: While Node.js is good at handling multiple concurrent connections, it may not be the best choice for applications that require heavy parallel processing.


4) Hash function in nodeJS:
A hash function in JavaScript is a function that takes an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a "digest" that is unique to each unique input, making it useful for various applications like data lookup, cryptography, and more.

Here’s an example of a simple hash function using the built-in `crypto` module in Node.js:

### Using Node.js `crypto` Module

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function hashString(str) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(str).digest('hex');
}

const myString = "Hello, world!";
const hashedString = hashString(myString);

console.log(hashedString);
```

In the example above:
- `crypto.createHash('sha256')` creates a hash object using the SHA-256 algorithm.
- `.update(str)` updates the hash object with the input string.
- `.digest('hex')` computes the hash and returns it as a hexadecimal string.

### Using Browser JavaScript (without Node.js)

For hashing in the browser, you can use the Web Crypto API, which is available in modern browsers:

```javascript
async function hashString(str) {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const data = encoder.encode(str);
  const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data);
  const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
  const hashHex = hashArray.map(byte => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
  return hashHex;
}

const myString = "Hello, world!";
hashString(myString).then(hashedString => console.log(hashedString));
```

In the example above:
- `TextEncoder` encodes the string into a `Uint8Array`.
- `crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data)` computes the SHA-256 hash.
- The result is converted to a hexadecimal string for easy readability.

### Simple Custom Hash Function

For educational purposes, here’s a simple (but not cryptographically secure) hash function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function simpleHash(str) {
  let hash = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    const char = str.charCodeAt(i);
    hash = (hash << 5) - hash + char;
    hash |= 0; // Convert to 32bit integer
  }
  return hash;
}

const myString = "Hello, world!";
const hashedString = simpleHash(myString);

console.log(hashedString);
```

This function:
- Iterates over each character in the string.
- Uses bitwise operations to compute a simple hash.

### Note

-- For security-sensitive applications, always use well-established libraries and algorithms like SHA-256 provided by the `crypto` module or Web Crypto API. Simple custom hash functions are generally not suitable for secure hashing. 
-- Decoding a hash function output to retrieve the original input is generally not possible. This is by design, as hash functions are intended to be one-way functions. Once data has been hashed, it cannot be easily reversed. Hash functions like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 are specifically designed to be irreversible.


5) Middleware:
Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between different parts of an application or between different applications. In web development, middleware typically refers to functions that process requests and responses in a web server or application framework before they reach the final handler or after they leave it. Middleware can perform a variety of tasks, such as logging, authentication, error handling, and data parsing.

### Key Points About Middleware:

1. **Intermediary**: Middleware functions operate between the client request and the server response, performing actions on the request and/or response objects.
2. **Reusable**: Middleware can be used across multiple routes and applications, making it a reusable component.
3. **Chaining**: Middleware functions can be chained together to handle requests in a sequential manner. Each middleware function can pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

### How Middleware Works:

When a request is received by the server, it passes through a series of middleware functions before reaching the final request handler. Each middleware function can modify the request or response, perform operations, and decide whether to pass control to the next function in the chain or end the response.

### Example in Express.js (a popular Node.js framework):

#### Logging Middleware Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function to log request details
function logRequests(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
}

app.use(logRequests);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example:
- `logRequests` is a middleware function that logs the request method and URL.
- `app.use(logRequests)` adds this middleware to the application, so it runs for every incoming request.
- The `next()` function is called to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

### Types of Middleware:

1. **Application-Level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of `express` using `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()`.
   
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log('Application-level middleware');
     next();
   });
   ```

2. **Router-Level Middleware**: Bound to an instance of `express.Router()`, used for modularizing the application.
   
   ```javascript
   const router = express.Router();
   
   router.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log('Router-level middleware');
     next();
   });
   
   app.use('/route', router);
   ```

3. **Error-Handling Middleware**: Defined with four arguments and used to handle errors in the application.
   
   ```javascript
   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
     console.error(err.stack);
     res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
   });
   ```

4. **Built-in Middleware**: Provided by Express, such as `express.static` for serving static files and `express.json` for parsing JSON payloads.
   
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.json());
   app.use(express.static('public'));
   ```

5. **Third-Party Middleware**: Middleware provided by third-party libraries, such as `morgan` for logging or `cors` for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
   
   ```javascript
   const morgan = require('morgan');
   app.use(morgan('tiny'));
   ```


6) REPL in node:
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive shell that processes single lines of input, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user. Node.js includes a built-in REPL that allows you to execute JavaScript code in a command-line environment interactively. This is useful for experimenting with code snippets, debugging, and learning.

To start the REPL, simply type node in your terminal and press Enter:
```
$ node```
You will see a prompt (>) where you can start typing JavaScript code.

7) Global object and module:
The global object in Node.js provides a way to define variables and functions that are accessible across different modules without importing them explicitly.
Global modules defined using the global object can be useful for sharing utility functions or constants across modules, but caution should be exercised to avoid polluting the global namespace.
Best practices in Node.js development often favor encapsulation and dependency injection over extensive use of global variables and modules to promote modularity and maintainability.

8) Js in browser vs Server-side:
JavaScript (JS) can operate in two primary environments: the browser and Node.js. Here's a comparison of JavaScript usage in these two contexts:

### JavaScript in Browser:

1. **Execution Environment:**
   - **Client-side:** JavaScript runs directly in the user's web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
   - **Interpreted:** Browsers interpret and execute JavaScript code natively.

2. **Core Capabilities:**
   - **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate webpage content dynamically.
   - **Event Handling:** Captures and responds to user actions (e.g., clicks, inputs) and browser events (e.g., load, resize).
   - **AJAX Requests:** Sends and receives data asynchronously to/from servers using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API.
   - **Animations:** Uses libraries like CSS transitions/animations or JavaScript frameworks (e.g., GSAP) for complex animations.

3. **ECMAScript Standards:**
   - **ES6+ Support:** Browsers progressively support modern JavaScript features specified in ECMAScript (ES) standards.

4. **Development Tools:**
   - **Browser Developer Tools:** Debugging, profiling, and inspecting DOM elements during development.

### JavaScript in Node.js Environment:

1. **Execution Environment:**
   - **Server-side:** JavaScript runs on the server using Node.js, a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
   - **Interpreted:** Node.js interprets JavaScript code and executes it on the server.

2. **Core Capabilities:**
   - **File System Operations:** Accesses and manipulates files and directories on the server.
   - **Server-Side Logic:** Handles backend logic, such as business operations, database interactions, and API endpoints.
   - **Command-Line Tools:** Develops and runs command-line utilities or scripts using Node.js.

3. **ECMAScript Standards:**
   - **ES6+ Support:** Node.js supports modern JavaScript features, often adopting them more quickly than browsers.

4. **Development Tools:**
   - **Node.js CLI:** Command-line tools for managing packages (npm or yarn), running scripts, and managing dependencies.
   - **Debugging:** Utilizes debuggers like Chrome DevTools (via inspector) or dedicated Node.js debuggers (e.g., VS Code debugger).

### Key Differences:

- **Environment:** Browser JS focuses on client-side interactions and UI, while Node.js JS handles server-side operations and backend logic.
- **APIs:** Browser JS interacts with DOM, handles events, and makes AJAX requests. Node.js JS manages files, databases, networking, and other server-side tasks.
- **Modules:** Node.js uses CommonJS (prior to ES6) or ES Modules (ES6+). Browser JS traditionally used `<script>` tags or module loaders (now supports ES Modules).
- **Concurrency:** Node.js operates with single-threaded, event-driven architecture (supports concurrency via async operations). Browsers handle concurrency with multi-threaded environments (e.g., Web Workers).



========================= 2.Modules in NodeJS========================================

1) CommonJS vs. ES6 Modules in Node.js
In Node.js, modules are a way to encapsulate code into separate files and reuse them across the application. There are two main module systems in use:

CommonJS Modules:

Usage: CommonJS is the older module system used in Node.js. It uses require to import modules and module.exports or exports to export them.
Syntax:
Importing: const math = require('./math.js');
Exporting: module.exports = { sum, mean };
Behavior: Synchronously loads modules, making it well-suited for server-side development.
ES6 Modules:

Usage: ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced a new standardized module system that is also supported in Node.js. It uses import and export statements.
Syntax:
Importing: import { sum, mean } from './math.js';
Exporting: export { sum, mean };

Behavior: Supports asynchronous module loading and can be used in both client-side and server-side JavaScript.
Key Differences
Syntax: CommonJS uses require and module.exports, while ES6 uses import and export.
Asynchronous Loading: ES6 modules are designed to support asynchronous loading, whereas CommonJS modules are synchronous.
Tree Shaking: ES6 modules support tree shaking, which allows bundlers to eliminate unused code.



========================= 14.Javascript : (Promises and Asyc/Await )========================================
1) Promise in js:
### Brief on Promises in JavaScript

**Promises** in JavaScript are objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable way than traditional callbacks.

A promise can be in one of the following states:
- **Pending**: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation was completed successfully.
- **Rejected**: The operation failed.

When a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it will call the appropriate handler (provided with `.then()` or `.catch()`), allowing you to manage asynchronous operations effectively.

#### Example: Basic Usage of a Promise

```javascript
// Create a new Promise
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true; // Simulating success or failure

    if (success) {
        resolve("The operation was successful!");
    } else {
        reject("The operation failed.");
    }
});

// Handle the Promise
myPromise
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result); // Output: The operation was successful!
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error); // If the promise was rejected
    });
```

### 15 Interview Questions on Promises in JavaScript

1. **What is a Promise in JavaScript?**
   - *Answer*: A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

2. **Explain the states of a Promise.**
   - *Answer*: A promise can be in three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

3. **How do you create a Promise?**
   - *Answer*: A Promise is created using the `new Promise()` constructor, which takes a function with `resolve` and `reject` as arguments.

4. **What are `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` in Promises?**
   - *Answer*: `.then()` is used to handle fulfilled promises, `.catch()` is for handling rejections, and `.finally()` is executed regardless of the promise's outcome.

5. **Can you chain Promises? How?**
   - *Answer*: Yes, promises can be chained using `.then()` to handle the result of the previous promise and return a new promise.

6. **What happens if you don't handle a rejected Promise?**
   - *Answer*: If a rejected promise is not handled, it may cause unhandled promise rejections, which can lead to errors in the application.

7. **Explain the difference between callbacks and Promises.**
   - *Answer*: Promises provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks, which can lead to "callback hell."

8. **What is the purpose of `Promise.all()`?**
   - *Answer*: `Promise.all()` runs multiple promises in parallel and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved.
   
   ```// Simulating asynchronous tasks with Promises
const task1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 1 completed");
    }, 1000); // Task 1 takes 1 second
});

const task2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 2 completed");
    }, 2000); // Task 2 takes 2 seconds
});

const task3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 3 completed");
    }, 1500); // Task 3 takes 1.5 seconds
});

// Using Promise.all to wait for all tasks to complete
Promise.all([task1, task2, task3])
    .then(results => {
        console.log("All tasks completed:");
        console.log(results); // Output: ["Task 1 completed", "Task 3 completed", "Task 2 completed"]
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log("One of the tasks failed:", error);
    });```


9. **How does `Promise.race()` work?**
   - *Answer*: `Promise.race()` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the input promises resolves or rejects.
   
   ```// Simulating asynchronous tasks with Promises
const task1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 1 completed");
    }, 3000); // Task 1 takes 3 seconds
});

const task2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Task 2 completed");
    }, 2000); // Task 2 takes 2 seconds
});

const task3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        reject("Task 3 failed");
    }, 1000); // Task 3 takes 1 second and fails
});

// Using Promise.race to get the first settled promise
Promise.race([task1, task2, task3])
    .then(result => {
        console.log("First settled task:", result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log("First settled task failed:", error);
    });```


10. **What is a `Promise.resolve()`?**
    - *Answer*: `Promise.resolve()` creates a promise that is immediately resolved with the given value.

11. **What is `Promise.reject()`?**
    - *Answer*: `Promise.reject()` creates a promise that is immediately rejected with the given reason.

12. **How can you convert a callback-based function to return a Promise?**
    - *Answer*: You can wrap the callback function inside a `new Promise()` and call `resolve` or `reject` based on the callback’s outcome.

13. **What is an async function in JavaScript, and how does it relate to Promises?**
    - *Answer*: An async function returns a Promise and allows you to write asynchronous code using `await`, making it look synchronous.

14. **How would you handle multiple asynchronous operations that need to happen sequentially?**
    - *Answer*: You can chain promises using `.then()` to ensure that each operation happens after the previous one has completed.

15. **Explain the concept of "Promise chaining".**
    - *Answer*: Promise chaining is the process of linking multiple promise handlers in a sequence, where each `.then()` or `.catch()` passes its result to the next.

14. **How would you handle errors in a chain of promises without stopping the entire chain?**

15. **Explain how to convert an array of callback-based functions into a chain of promises.**

2) Why promise status show fulfilled after it reject?

### Understanding the "Fulfilled" Status in the Console

When you inspect a promise in the browser's developer console, you might see something like this:

```javascript
Promise {<rejected>: "The operation failed."}
```

However, in the console, you might see the following structure when expanding the promise object:

```javascript
[[PromiseStatus]]: "fulfilled"
[[PromiseResult]]: "The operation failed."
```

This can be confusing, but here's what actually happens:

### Explanation

- **Promise Status in Console:**
  - The term "fulfilled" in the console doesn't refer to the success of the operation but rather indicates that the promise has "settled"—meaning it is no longer in the "pending" state. The promise has finished its execution and has either been resolved or rejected.
  - The `[[PromiseStatus]]` in the console reflects that the promise has finished processing, which is why it says "fulfilled." 

- **PromiseResult:**
  - The `[[PromiseResult]]` shows what the promise resolved or rejected with. In this case, it shows `"The operation failed."`, indicating that the promise was rejected.

- The console uses the term "fulfilled" to indicate that the promise has completed, regardless of whether it was resolved or rejected.
- To determine if a promise was rejected, you should look at the `[[PromiseResult]]` and see the value it holds. If it’s a rejection message, that confirms the promise was rejected.

3) How status changing during api call?
When an API call is made in JavaScript using promises, the underlying process involves several steps that handle the asynchronous nature of the operation. Understanding how the browser or JavaScript engine handles these steps can shed light on how it knows whether the operation is successful or has failed.

### 1. **Initiating the API Call**
   - When you use a method like `fetch()` to make an API call, the JavaScript engine sends an HTTP request to the specified server. This request is sent asynchronously, meaning it doesn't block the execution of other code.
   - At this point, a `Promise` object is created, and its initial state is `pending`.

### 2. **Event Loop and Web APIs**
   - The actual API call is handled by the browser's Web APIs (in a browser environment) or the event loop and libuv (in Node.js).
   - The JavaScript engine hands off the request to these lower-level systems, which manage the communication with the server. The promise remains in a `pending` state.

### 3. **Receiving the Response**
   - The server processes the request and sends back a response. This response could be a success (with data) or an error (like a 404 or 500 status code).
   - Once the response is received by the Web APIs or event loop, it's queued for processing by the JavaScript engine.

### 4. **Callback Queues and Microtasks**
   - Once the response is ready, a callback function associated with the `fetch()` method (or other similar methods) is placed in the **microtask queue**.
   - The event loop monitors both the **call stack** and the **microtask queue**. When the call stack is clear, the event loop picks the next microtask (which includes the callback from the `fetch()` response) to process.

### 5. **Promise Resolution**
   - The callback function associated with the promise (like `.then()` for success or `.catch()` for errors) is executed based on the nature of the response:
     - **If the response is successful** (status code 200-299), the `resolve()` function is called within the promise, changing its state from `pending` to `fulfilled`. The value (response data) is passed along as the promise's result.
     - **If the response fails** (status code outside 200-299, network error, etc.), the `reject()` function is called, changing the promise's state from `pending` to `rejected`. The error or rejection reason is passed along as the promise's result.

### 6. **Handling the Result**
   - The result of the promise (whether fulfilled or rejected) is then handled by the associated `.then()` or `.catch()` callbacks.
   - The JavaScript engine automatically updates the promise's state based on whether `resolve()` or `reject()` was called.

### Example Flow

```javascript
const apiCall = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Step 1: Initiating the API call
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => {
            // Step 5a: If successful, resolve the promise
            if (response.ok) {
                return response.json();
            } else {
                // Step 5b: If not successful, reject the promise
                throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
            }
        })
        .then(data => {
            // Step 6a: Handle successful data
            resolve(data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            // Step 6b: Handle the error
            reject(error);
        });
});

// Usage
apiCall
    .then(data => console.log("Data received:", data))
    .catch(error => console.log("Failed to fetch data:", error));
```

### What Happens Internally

- **`fetch()` Execution:** The JavaScript engine offloads the HTTP request to the browser's Web API, and the promise is created with a `pending` state.
- **Response Handling:** Once the server responds, the browser's Web API or event loop schedules the response handler in the microtask queue.
- **Promise State Change:** The promise's state is updated based on whether the operation succeeded (`resolve()`) or failed (`reject()`).
- **Result Handling:** The appropriate callback (`.then()` or `.catch()`) is executed, handling the result of the promise.

### Conclusion

The JavaScript engine and its event loop, together with Web APIs or libuv (in Node.js), manage the asynchronous operation. The key lies in the `resolve()` and `reject()` functions within the `Promise` constructor, which the JavaScript engine automatically invokes based on the outcome of the asynchronous task. This is how the promise transitions from `pending` to `fulfilled` or `rejected`, and how it "knows" whether the operation succeeded or failed.

4) Event-looping:

The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows asynchronous operations to be processed without blocking the execution of other code. JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time in a single thread. However, with the help of the event loop, JavaScript can handle multiple operations efficiently, giving the illusion of multitasking.

#### How the Event Loop Works

1. **Call Stack:**
   - The call stack is a data structure that tracks the execution of functions. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the stack.

2. **Web APIs:**
   - In a browser environment, Web APIs (like `setTimeout`, `DOM events`, `fetch`, etc.) handle tasks asynchronously. These tasks are offloaded to the Web APIs, freeing up the call stack to continue executing other code.

3. **Callback Queue (Task Queue):**
   - Once an asynchronous task (like a `setTimeout` or an API call) is completed, its callback function is added to the callback queue.

4. **Event Loop:**
   - The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, the event loop picks the next function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

5. **Microtask Queue:**
   - Promises and some other operations are handled using the microtask queue, which has a higher priority than the callback queue. Microtasks are processed right after the currently executing task completes and before the event loop moves on to the next task in the callback queue.

#### Visualizing the Event Loop

Here's a simplified diagram:

```
+-------------------+
|    Call Stack     | <-- Executes one task at a time
+-------------------+
        |
        v
+-------------------+
|  Web APIs/Threads | <-- Handles async operations like setTimeout, fetch, etc.
+-------------------+
        |
        v
+-------------------+          +-------------------+
|  Callback Queue   | <----+   |  Microtask Queue  | <-- Higher priority
+-------------------+      |   +-------------------+
        |                  |
        v                  |
+-------------------+      |
|   Event Loop      | <----+
+-------------------+
```

#### Example: Understanding the Event Loop

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("Promise callback");
});

console.log("End");
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Start
End
Promise callback
Timeout callback
```

**Explanation:**
1. `console.log("Start")` is executed first and logged to the console.
2. `setTimeout()` is called, but its callback is added to the callback queue after 0 milliseconds. This doesn't run immediately because it's handled by the Web APIs and then added to the callback queue.
3. The promise is resolved immediately, and its `.then()` callback is added to the microtask queue.
4. `console.log("End")` is executed and logged to the console.
5. The event loop finds the call stack empty and processes the microtask queue first, executing the promise callback (`Promise callback`).
6. Finally, the event loop picks the `setTimeout` callback from the callback queue and executes it (`Timeout callback`).

### Interview Questions on Event Loop

1. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**
   - **Answer:** The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite being single-threaded. It continuously checks the call stack and callback/microtask queues to manage the execution of functions.

2. **How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations with the event loop?**
   - **Answer:** JavaScript uses the event loop to offload asynchronous operations to the Web APIs or Node.js's libuv, which manage these operations. Once completed, the event loop processes their callbacks in the appropriate queue.

3. **What is the difference between the callback queue and the microtask queue?**
   - **Answer:** The microtask queue (for promises and other microtasks) has higher priority and is processed before the callback queue (for `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, etc.).

4. **Why is the output of the following code `1, 3, 2`?**
   ```javascript
   console.log(1);
   setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);
   console.log(3);
   ```
   - **Answer:** The `setTimeout` callback is added to the callback queue and only executed after the call stack is empty. Hence, `1` and `3` are logged first, followed by `2`.

5. **Can you explain what happens when a promise is resolved?**
   - **Answer:** When a promise is resolved, its `.then()` callback is added to the microtask queue. The event loop processes this queue before moving on to the callback queue.

6. **What is the significance of the event loop in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** In Node.js, the event loop is crucial for handling I/O operations, allowing the server to handle many connections simultaneously without blocking the execution of code.

### Tricky Challenges

1. **Predict the output:**
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
   console.log('sync');
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `sync`, `promise`, `timeout`

2. **Explain the behavior:**
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
   setImmediate(() => console.log('immediate'));
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** This depends on the environment (browser vs. Node.js).

3. **What will the following code output?**
   ```javascript
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise1'));
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise2'));
   console.log('sync');
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `sync`, `promise1`, `promise2`

4. **Describe the output and order of execution:**
   ```javascript
   process.nextTick(() => console.log('tick'));
   Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
   setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `tick`, `promise`, `timeout`

5. **Why does this code output `1, 4, 3, 2`?**
   ```javascript
   console.log(1);
   setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 1000);
   setTimeout(() => console.log(3), 0);
   console.log(4);
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `1`, `4`, `3`, `2`

6. **What is the purpose of `process.nextTick()` in Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** It defers the execution of a function until the current operation completes, but before the event loop continues.

5) Prototype chaining:

Prototype chaining is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that enables objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This mechanism is essential for implementing inheritance in JavaScript.

#### What is Prototype Chaining?

Prototype chaining refers to the ability of objects to delegate property and method lookups to their prototype objects. When you access a property or method of an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If it doesn't find it there, it looks up the prototype chain, which is a series of prototypes that the object is linked to.

### Key Concepts

1. **Prototype:**
   - Every JavaScript object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]` (often accessed via `__proto__` in older code or via `Object.getPrototypeOf()`).
   - This prototype is itself an object, and it may have its own prototype, forming a chain.

2. **Prototype Chain:**
   - The prototype chain is a series of objects linked together. When a property or method is accessed, JavaScript traverses this chain to find the property or method.

3. **`Object.prototype`:**
   - At the top of every prototype chain is `Object.prototype`. If a property or method is not found on the object or its prototypes, JavaScript will check `Object.prototype`. If it's still not found, it returns `undefined`.

4. **Inheritance:**
   - Prototype chaining allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This mechanism is used to create inheritance hierarchies.

### Example of Prototype Chaining

```javascript
// Define a constructor function
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

// Add a method to the Animal prototype
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
};

// Define another constructor function
function Dog(name, breed) {
    Animal.call(this, name); // Call the parent constructor
    this.breed = breed;
}

// Set up prototype chaining
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Inherit from Animal
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog; // Set the constructor property

// Add a method to the Dog prototype
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
};

// Create instances
const dog = new Dog('Rex', 'German Shepherd');

// Access methods and properties
dog.speak(); // Inherited from Animal
dog.bark();  // Defined in Dog
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Animal Constructor Function:** Defines an `Animal` with a `name` and a `speak` method.
2. **Dog Constructor Function:** Inherits from `Animal` and adds its own property `breed` and method `bark`.
3. **Prototype Chain Setup:** `Dog.prototype` is set to an object created from `Animal.prototype`. This makes `Dog` inherit from `Animal`.
4. **Creating Instances:** `dog` is an instance of `Dog` and has access to both `speak` (inherited) and `bark` (own method).

### Understanding Prototype Chain Lookup

When you access `dog.speak()`, JavaScript performs the following steps:

1. **Check `dog`:** Look for the `speak` method directly on `dog`. It's not found.
2. **Check `Dog.prototype`:** Look for the `speak` method on `Dog.prototype`. It's not there.
3. **Check `Animal.prototype`:** Look for the `speak` method on `Animal.prototype`. It's found and executed.
4. **Check `Object.prototype`:** If the method were not found, JavaScript would check `Object.prototype`.

### Interview Questions on Prototype Chaining

1. **What is prototype chaining in JavaScript?**
   - **Answer:** Prototype chaining is the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from other objects through their prototype chain.

2. **How do you set up inheritance using prototype chaining?**
   - **Answer:** Inherit from a parent constructor by setting the prototype of the child constructor to an object created from the parent’s prototype, and set the child's prototype constructor to the child constructor.

3. **What is the role of `Object.create()` in prototype chaining?**
   - **Answer:** `Object.create()` creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties, allowing for easy setup of inheritance.

4. **Explain how `Object.prototype` fits into prototype chaining.**
   - **Answer:** `Object.prototype` is at the end of every prototype chain. If a property or method is not found on the object or its prototypes, JavaScript checks `Object.prototype`.

5. **How can you access an object's prototype?**
   - **Answer:** You can access an object's prototype using `Object.getPrototypeOf(object)` or `object.__proto__` (though the latter is deprecated).

### Tricky Challenges

1. **What will be the output of this code?**
   ```javascript
   function Animal() {}
   Animal.prototype.sound = 'roar';
   const animal = new Animal();
   console.log(animal.sound); // 'roar'
   Animal.prototype.sound = 'growl';
   console.log(animal.sound); // 'growl'
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `roar`, `growl`

2. **Describe the output:**
   ```javascript
   function Parent() {}
   function Child() {}
   Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
   Child.prototype.constructor = Child;

   const instance = new Child();
   console.log(instance instanceof Child); // true
   console.log(instance instanceof Parent); // true
   console.log(instance instanceof Object); // true
   ```

3. **Explain why the following code outputs `true` and `false`:**
   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
       this.name = name;
   }

   Person.prototype.greet = function() {
       return 'Hello, ' + this.name;
   };

   const p = new Person('John');
   console.log(p.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
   console.log(p.__proto__.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
   ```

4. **What will be the output of this code and why?**
   ```javascript
   function Animal() {}
   Animal.prototype = { sound: 'roar' };
   const animal = new Animal();
   console.log(animal.sound); // 'roar'
   Animal.prototype.sound = 'growl';
   console.log(animal.sound); // 'roar'
   ```

5. **Explain why this code results in an error:**
   ```javascript
   function Parent() {}
   Parent.prototype.method = function() {};
   function Child() {}
   Child.prototype = Parent.prototype;
   const child = new Child();
   child.method = function() {};
   console.log(new Parent().method); // Function() {}
   ```

Prototype chaining is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows for efficient inheritance and property sharing. Understanding how it works is essential for mastering JavaScript's object-oriented programming capabilities.

6) Predefined Promises:
Certainly! JavaScript provides several built-in (or predefined) promises and functions that return promises. These are particularly useful for handling asynchronous operations. Here’s a list of some common predefined promises and promise-related functions in JavaScript:

### 1. **`Promise.resolve(value)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that is resolved with the given value.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const promise = Promise.resolve('Resolved value');
     promise.then(value => console.log(value)); // Output: 'Resolved value'
     ```

### 2. **`Promise.reject(reason)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const promise = Promise.reject(new Error('Rejected reason'));
     promise.catch(error => console.log(error.message)); // Output: 'Rejected reason'
     ```

### 3. **`Promise.all(iterable)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable have resolved or rejects if any of the promises reject.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
     const p2 = Promise.resolve(2);
     const p3 = Promise.resolve(3);

     Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
       .then(values => console.log(values)); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
     ```

### 4. **`Promise.allSettled(iterable)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either resolved or rejected, with an array of objects describing the outcome of each promise.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
     const p2 = Promise.reject(new Error('Failed'));
     const p3 = Promise.resolve(3);

     Promise.allSettled([p1, p2, p3])
       .then(results => console.log(results));
     // Output: [{ status: 'fulfilled', value: 1 }, { status: 'rejected', reason: Error: Failed }, { status: 'fulfilled', value: 3 }]
     ```

### 5. **`Promise.any(iterable)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that resolves as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves, or rejects if no promises in the iterable resolve.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p1 = Promise.reject('Fail 1');
     const p2 = Promise.resolve('Success');
     const p3 = Promise.reject('Fail 2');

     Promise.any([p1, p2, p3])
       .then(value => console.log(value)); // Output: 'Success'
     ```

### 6. **`Promise.race(iterable)`**
   - **Description:** Returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'First'));
     const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'Second'));

     Promise.race([p1, p2])
       .then(value => console.log(value)); // Output: 'Second'
     ```

### 7. **`Promise.resolve().then()`**
   - **Description:** A way to use the `Promise.resolve()` to immediately resolve a promise and schedule a callback to be executed asynchronously.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Executed asynchronously'));
     // Output: 'Executed asynchronously'
     ```

### 8. **`Promise.finally(onFinally)`**
   - **Description:** Adds a final callback that will be executed regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const p = Promise.resolve('Done');

     p.then(value => console.log(value))
      .finally(() => console.log('Final block executed'));
     // Output: 'Done'
     // Output: 'Final block executed'
     ```

### Summary

These predefined promises and promise-related methods provide a robust set of tools for handling asynchronous operations and coordinating multiple promises in JavaScript. They are crucial for managing asynchronous workflows and ensuring predictable outcomes in modern JavaScript applications.


========================= Project:- Inventory management Project==========================
1) MVC in Nodejs:-

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern used in software development, and it's especially common in web applications. It helps organize code into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. Here's how MVC works in Node.js:

### 1. **Model**
   - **Role**: Represents the data layer of the application. It defines the structure of the data, interacts with the database, and handles the business logic.
   - **Example in Node.js**: Using a model might involve defining a schema with Mongoose (if using MongoDB) or setting up SQL queries (if using a relational database).

### 2. **View**
   - **Role**: Represents the presentation layer. It defines how the data should be displayed to the user. In Node.js, views are often created using template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars.
   - **Example in Node.js**: An EJS template that renders HTML by injecting data from the model.

### 3. **Controller**
   - **Role**: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles the request from the user, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and then sends the appropriate data to the View for presentation.
   - **Example in Node.js**: A controller function that handles a specific route, retrieves data from the database through the Model, and renders the appropriate view.

### How it works together in Node.js:
- **Request Flow**: 
  1. A user sends a request (e.g., accessing a webpage).
  2. The **Controller** receives the request and processes it.
  3. The **Controller** interacts with the **Model** to retrieve or modify data.
  4. The **Model** returns the data to the **Controller**.
  5. The **Controller** passes the data to the **View**.
  6. The **View** generates the final HTML/CSS/JS that is sent back to the user.

### Example in Node.js (Inventory Management Project):
- **Model**: You might have a `Product` model that defines the structure for inventory items.
- **View**: You could have EJS templates that display the list of products, forms for adding new products, etc.
- **Controller**: You might have a `ProductController` that handles routes like `/products` (list products), `/products/add` (show form to add product), and `/products/:id` (view details of a specific product).

This separation of concerns makes your code more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. Since you’re working on an inventory management project with an MVC structure, each part of the project (data handling, user interface, and request logic) would be neatly organized in these three components.

2)Express in NodeJS:
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building web applications by providing tools and utilities for managing routes, handling requests and responses, middleware support, and more.

### Key Features of Express:
1. **Routing**:
   - Express allows you to define routes to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL paths.
   - For example, you can create routes for different parts of your application, such as `/home`, `/products`, or `/users`.

2. **Middleware**:
   - Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
   - Middleware can be used for tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, handling errors, etc.

3. **View Rendering**:
   - Express supports various template engines (like EJS, Pug, Handlebars) for generating HTML dynamically based on your data.
   - You can set up a view engine and render templates with dynamic content.

4. **HTTP Utility Methods**:
   - Express provides a set of HTTP utility methods to manage responses, such as setting headers, sending JSON data, sending status codes, and more.

5. **Static File Serving**:
   - You can easily serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript using the `express.static` middleware.

6. **Simple and Minimalistic**:
   - Express is unopinionated, meaning it doesn’t enforce a specific structure or way of doing things. You have the flexibility to organize your application as you see fit.

7. **Extensible**:
   - Express has a rich ecosystem of third-party middleware and plugins, allowing you to extend its functionality as needed.

### Basic Example of an Express Application:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route for the home page
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server and listen on a specific port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this example:
- `express()` creates an Express application.
- `app.get()` defines a route for the root URL (`/`) that sends "Hello, World!" as a response.
- `app.listen()` starts the server and listens on port 3000.

### Why Use Express?
- **Ease of Use**: Express abstracts away much of the boilerplate code involved in setting up a web server, making it quicker to develop applications.
- **Flexibility**: It allows you to build everything from simple static websites to complex, full-featured web applications.
- **Large Ecosystem**: The availability of middleware and extensions means you can easily add features like authentication, validation, logging, and more.
- **Compatibility**: It works well with various databases, templating engines, and other Node.js tools.

Express is widely used for building APIs, single-page applications (SPAs), web applications, and microservices.

3) Serving Static files:-

Serving static files refers to the process of delivering files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, and other assets directly to the client (usually a web browser) from the server without any server-side processing or logic. These files are "static" because they don't change dynamically based on the request; they are delivered as-is.

In the Context of Express.js:
In an Express.js application, serving static files is a common requirement. You typically want to make certain files (like your site's CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, images, etc.) accessible to users directly through the web server.

How to Serve Static Files in Express:
Express has a built-in middleware function called express.static() that makes it easy to serve static files. You just need to specify the directory where your static files are located, and Express will automatically handle requests for those files.

Here's how you can set up Express to serve these files:

```
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Serve static files from the "public" directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});```

***Benefits of Serving Static Files***:
Performance: Static files are delivered quickly because they don’t require server-side processing.
Simplicity: Static files are straightforward to manage and serve, making them ideal for assets that don’t need to change dynamically.
Efficiency: Reduces server load because the server doesn’t have to generate a response dynamically.

***Use Cases***:
Website Assets: CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts used by your website.
Downloadable Files: PDFs, documents, or any other file you want users to be able to download directly.
Client-Side Code: Files that are part of your frontend codebase, like React or Angular bundles.

4) Template Engine:
A template engine in Node.js is used to generate dynamic HTML by combining templates with data. Popular template engines include EJS, Pug, and Handlebars. They allow you to create reusable components and separate logic from presentation.

5) HTTP request logger:
An HTTP request logger is a middleware that logs details about incoming HTTP requests, such as the request method, URL, status code, and response time. This is useful for monitoring and debugging your application.i.e Morgan
